<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>
The sense of difficulty, and indeed of awe, with which a scholar approaches the
task of translating the <i>Agamemnon</i> depends directly on its greatness as
poetry. It is in part a matter of diction. The language of Aeschylus is an
extraordinary thing, the syntax stiff and simple, the vocabulary obscure,
unexpected, and steeped in splendour. Its peculiarities cannot be disregarded,
or the translation will be false in character. Yet not Milton himself could
produce in English the same great music, and a translator who should strive
ambitiously to represent the complex effect of the original would clog his own
powers of expression and strain his instrument to breaking. But, apart from the
diction in this narrower sense, there is a quality of atmosphere surrounding
the <i>Agamemnon</i> which seems almost to defy reproduction in another
setting, because it depends in large measure on the position of the play in the
historical development of Greek literature.
</p>
<p>
If we accept the view that all Art to some extent, and Greek tragedy in a very
special degree, moves in its course of development from Religion to
Entertainment, from a Service to a Performance, the <i>Agamemnon</i> seems to
stand at a critical point where the balance of the two elements is near
perfection. The drama has come fully to life, but the religion has not yet
faded to a formality. The <i>Agamemnon</i> is not, like Aeschylus’
<i>Suppliant Women</i>, a statue half-hewn out of the rock. It is a real play,
showing clash of character and situation, suspense and movement, psychological
depth and subtlety. Yet it still remains something more than a play. Its
atmosphere is not quite of this world. In the long lyrics especially one feels
that the guiding emotion is not the entertainer’s wish to thrill an
audience, not even perhaps the pure artist’s wish to create beauty, but
something deeper and more prophetic, a passionate contemplation and expression
of truth; though of course the truth in question is something felt rather than
stated, something that pervades life, an eternal and majestic rhythm like the
movement of the stars.
</p>
<p>
Thus, if Longinus is right in defining Sublimity as “the ring, or
resonance, of greatness of soul,” one sees in part where the sublimity of
the <i>Agamemnon</i> comes from. And it is worth noting that the faults which
some critics have found in the play are in harmony with this conclusion. For
the sublimity that is rooted in religion tolerates some faults and utterly
refuses to tolerate others. The <i>Agamemnon</i> may be slow in getting to
work; it may be stiff with antique conventions. It never approaches to being
cheap or insincere or shallow or sentimental or showy. It never ceases to be
genuinely a “criticism of life.” The theme which it treats, for
instance, is a great theme in its own right; it is not a made-up story
ingeniously handled.
</p>
<p>
The trilogy of the <i>Oresteia</i>, of which this play is the first part,
centres on the old and everlastingly unsolved problem of
</p>
<p class="poem">
The ancient blinded vengeance and the wrong that amendeth wrong.
</p>
<p>
Every wrong is justly punished; yet, as the world goes, every punishment
becomes a new wrong, calling for fresh vengeance. And more; every wrong turns
out to be itself rooted in some wrong of old. It is never gratuitous, never
untempted by the working of Peitho (Persuasion), never merely wicked. The
<i>Oresteia</i> first shows the cycle of crime punished by crime which must be
repunished, and then seeks for some gleam of escape, some breaking of the
endless chain of “evil duty.” In the old order of earth and heaven
there was no such escape. Each blow called for the return blow and must do so
<i>ad infinitum</i>. But, according to Aeschylus, there is a new Ruler now in
heaven, one who has both sinned and suffered and thereby grown wise. He is Zeus
the Third Power, Zeus the Saviour, and his gift to mankind is the ability
through suffering to Learn (pp. 7 f.)
</p>
<p>
At the opening of the <i>Agamemnon</i> we find Clytemnestra alienated from her
husband and secretly befriended with his ancestral enemy, Aigisthos. The air is
heavy and throbbing with hate; hate which is evil but has its due cause.
Agamemnon, obeying the prophet Calchas, when the fleet lay storm-bound at
Aulis, had given his own daughter, Iphigenîa, as a human sacrifice. And if we
ask how a sane man had consented to such an act, we are told of his gradual
temptation; the deadly excuse offered by ancient superstition; and above all,
the fact that he had already inwardly accepted the great whole of which this
horror was a part. At the first outset of his expedition against Troy there had
appeared an omen, the bloody sign of two eagles devouring a mother-hare with
her unborn young…. The question was thus put to the Kings and their prophet:
Did they or did they not accept the sign, and wish to be those Eagles? And they
had answered Yes. They would have their vengeance, their full and extreme
victory, and were ready to pay the price. The sign once accepted, the prophet
recoils from the consequences which, in prophetic vision, he sees following
therefrom: but the decision has been taken, and the long tale of cruelty rolls
on, culminating in the triumphant sack of Troy, which itself becomes not an
assertion of Justice but a whirlwind of godless destruction. And through all
these doings of fierce beasts and angry men the unseen Pity has been alive and
watching, the Artemis who “abhors the Eagles’ feast,” the
“Apollo or Pan or Zeus” who hears the crying of the robbed vulture;
nay, if even the Gods were deaf, the mere “wrong of the dead” at
Troy might waken, groping for some retribution upon the “Slayer of Many
Men” (pp. 15, 20).
</p>
<p>
If we ask why men are so blind, seeking their welfare thus through incessant
evil, Aeschylus will tell us that the cause lies in the infection of old sin,
old cruelty. There is no doubt somewhere a
πρώταρχος Ἄτη, a
“first blind deed of wrong,” but in practice every wrong is the
result of another. And the Children of Atreus are steeped to the lips in them.
When the prophetess Cassandra, out of her first vague horror at the evil House,
begins to grope towards some definite image, first and most haunting comes the
sound of the weeping of two little children, murdered long ago, in a feud that
was not theirs. From that point, more than any other, the Daemon or Genius of
the House—more than its “Luck,” a little less than its
Guardian Angel—becomes an Alastor or embodied Curse, a “Red
Slayer” which cries ever for peace and cleansing, but can seek them only
in the same blind way, through vengeance, and, when that fails, then through
more vengeance (p. 69).
</p>
<p>
This awful conception of a race intent upon its own wrongs, and blindly groping
towards the very terror it is trying to avoid, is typified, as it were, in the
Cassandra story. That daughter of Priam was beloved by Apollo, who gave her the
power of true prophecy. In some way that we know not, she broke her promise to
the God; and, since his gift could not be recalled, he added to it the curse
that, while she should always foresee and foretell the truth, none should
believe her. The Cassandra scene is a creation beyond praise or criticism. The
old scholiast speaks of the “pity and amazement” which it causes.
The Elders who talk with her wish to believe, they try to understand, they are
really convinced of Cassandra’s powers. But the curse is too strong. The
special thing which Cassandra tries again and again to say always eludes them,
and they can raise no finger to prevent the disaster happening. And when it
does happen they are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old,
“dreams wandering in the daylight.”
</p>
<p>
The characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme and
consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further significance
which is almost symbolic. Cassandra is, as it were, the incarnation of that
knowledge which Herodotus describes as the crown of sorrow, the knowledge which
sees and warns and cannot help (Hdt. ix. 16). Agamemnon himself, the King of
Kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol of pride and the fall of pride. We
must not think of him as bad or specially cruel. The watchman loved him (ll. 34
f.), and the lamentations of the Elders over his death have a note of personal
affection (pp. 66 ff.). But I suspect that Aeschylus, a believer in the mystic
meaning of names, took the name Agamemnon to be a warning that
Ἄγα μίμνει, “the unseen
Wrath abides.” <i>Agâ</i>, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is more
like Nemesis, the feeling that something is ἄγαν,
“too much,” the condemnation of <i>Hubris</i> (pride or overgrowth)
and of all things that are in excess. <i>Agâ</i> is sometimes called “the
jealousy of God,” but such a translation is not happy. It is not the
jealousy, nor even the indignation, of a personal God, but the profound
repudiation and reversal of Hubris which is the very law of the Cosmos. Through
all the triumph of the conqueror, this <i>Agâ</i> abides.
</p>
<p>
The greatest and most human character of the whole play is Clytemnestra. She is
conceived on the grand Aeschylean scale, a scale which makes even Lady Macbeth
and Beatrice Cenci seem small; she is more the kinswoman of Brynhild. Yet she
is full not only of character, but of subtle psychology. She is the first and
leading example of that time-honoured ornament of the tragic stage, the
sympathetic, or semi-sympathetic, heroine-criminal. Aeschylus employs none of
the devices of later playwrights to make her interesting. He admits, of course,
no approach to a love-scene; he uses no sophisms; but he does make us see
through Clytemnestra’s eyes and feel through her passions. The agony of
silent prayer in which, if my conception is right, we first see her, helps to
interpret her speeches when they come; but every speech needs close study. She
dare not speak sincerely or show her real feelings until Agamemnon is dead; and
then she is practically a mad woman.
</p>
<p>
For I think here that there is a point which has not been observed. It is that
Clytemnestra is conceived as being really “possessed” by the Daemon
of the House when she commits her crime. Her statements on p. 69 are not empty
metaphor. A careful study of the scene after the murder will show that she
appears first “possessed” and almost insane with triumph, utterly
dominating the Elders and leaving them no power to answer. Then gradually the
unnatural force dies out from her. The deed that was first an ecstasy of
delight becomes an “affliction” (pp. 72, 76). The strength that
defied the world flags and changes into a longing for peace. She has done her
work. She has purified the House of its madness; now let her go away and live
out her life in quiet. When Aigisthos appears, and the scene suddenly becomes
filled with the wrangling of common men, Clytemnestra fades into a long
silence, from which she only emerges at the very end of the drama to pray again
for Peace, and, strangest of all, to utter the entreaty: “Let us not
stain ourselves with blood!” The splash of her husband’s blood was
visible on her face at the time. Had she in her trance-like state actually
forgotten, or did she, even then, not feel that particular blood to be a stain?
</p>
<p>
To some readers it will seem a sort of irrelevance, or at least a blurring of
the dramatic edge of this tragedy, to observe that the theme on which it is
founded was itself the central theme both of Greek Tragedy and of Greek
Religion. The fall of Pride, the avenging of wrong by wrong, is no new subject
selected by Aeschylus. It forms both the commonest burden of the moralising
lyrics in Greek tragedy and even of the tragic myths themselves; and recent
writers have shown how the same idea touches the very heart of the traditional
Greek religion. “The life of the Year-Daemon, who lies at the root of so
many Greek gods and heroes, is normally a story of Pride and Punishment. Each
year arrives, waxes great, commits the sin of Hubris and must therefore die. It
is the way of all Life. As an early philosopher expresses it, “All things
pay retribution for their injustice one to another according to the ordinance
of Time.”<a href="#fn-1.1" id="fnref-1.1" class="pginternal"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
To me this consideration actually increases the interest and beauty of the
<i>Oresteia</i>, because it increases its greatness. The majestic art, the
creative genius, the instinctive eloquence of these plays—that eloquence
which is the mere despair of a translator—are all devoted to the
expression of something which Aeschylus felt to be of tremendous import. It was
not his discovery; but it was a truth of which he had an intense realization.
It had become something which he must with all his strength bring to expression
before he died, not in a spirit of self-assertion or of argument, like a
discoverer, but as one devoted to something higher and greater than himself, in
the spirit of an interpreter or prophet.

This waste of year-long vigil I have prayed<br/>
God for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,<br/>

Till well I know yon midnight festival<br/>
Of swarming stars, and them that lonely go,<br/>
Bearers to man of summer and of snow,<br/>
Great lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.<br/>
And still I await the sign, the beacon pyre<br/>
That bears Troy’s capture on a voice of flame<br/>
Shouting o’erseas. So surely to her aim<br/>
Cleaveth a woman’s heart, man-passioned!<br/>
And when I turn me to my bed—my bed<br/>
Dew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near<br/>
Cometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear<br/>
Breathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain<br/>
To close may close too well to wake again;<br/>
Think I perchance to sing or troll a tune<br/>
For medicine against sleep, the music soon<br/>
Changes to sighing for the tale untold<br/>
Of this house, not well mastered as of old.<br/>

To this glad lamp her women’s triumph-song,<br/>

A Fire-god, from Mount Ida scattering flame.<br/>
Whence starting, beacon after beacon burst<br/>
In flaming message hitherward. Ida first<br/>
Told Hermes’ Lemnian Rock, whose answering sign<br/>
Was caught by towering Athos, the divine,<br/>
With pines immense—yea, fishes of the night<br/>
Swam skyward, drunken with that leaping light,<br/>
Which swelled like some strange sun, till dim and far<br/>
Makistos’ watchmen marked a glimmering star;<br/>
They, nowise loath nor idly slumber-won,<br/>
Spring up to hurl the fiery message on,<br/>
And a far light beyond the Eurîpus tells<br/>
That word hath reached Messapion’s sentinels.<br/>
They beaconed back, then onward with a high<br/>
Heap of dead heather flaming to the sky.<br/>
And onward still, not failing nor aswoon,<br/>
Across the Asôpus like a beaming moon<br/>
The great word leapt, and on Kithairon’s height<br/>
Uproused a new relay of racing light.<br/>
His watchers knew the wandering flame, nor hid<br/>
Their welcome, burning higher than was bid.<br/>
Out over Lake Gorgôpis then it floats,<br/>
To Aigiplanctos, waking the wild goats,<br/>
Crying for “Fire, more Fire!” And fire was reared,<br/>
Stintless and high, a stormy streaming beard,<br/>
That waved in flame beyond the promontory<br/>
Rock-ridged, that watches the Saronian sea,<br/>
Kindling the night: then one short swoop to catch<br/>
The Spider’s Crag, our city’s tower of watch;<br/>
Whence hither to the Atreidae’s roof it came,<br/>
A light true-fathered of Idaean flame.<br/>
Torch-bearer after torch-bearer, behold<br/>

Each one by each made perfect ere it passed,<br/>
And <a href="#fn-15" id="fnref-15" class="pginternal">Victory in the first as in the last.</a><br/>

Now, even now, the Achaian holdeth Troy!<br/>
Methinks there is a crying in her streets<br/>
That makes no concord. When sweet unguent meets<br/>
With vinegar in one phial, I warrant none<br/>
Shall lay those wranglers lovingly at one.<br/>
So conquerors and conquered shalt thou hear,<br/>
Two sundered tones, two lives of joy or fear.<br/>
Here women in the dust about their slain,<br/>
Husbands or brethren, and by dead old men<br/>
Pale children who shall never more be free,<br/>
For all they loved on earth cry desolately.<br/>
And hard beside them war-stained Greeks, whom stark<br/>
Battle and then long searching through the dark<br/>
Hath gathered, ravenous, in the dawn, to feast<br/>
At last on all the plenty Troy possessed,<br/>
No portion in that feast nor ordinance,<br/>
But each man clutching at the prize of chance.<br/>
Aye, there at last under good roofs they lie<br/>
Of men spear-quelled, no frosts beneath the sky,<br/>
No watches more, no bitter moony dew….<br/>
How blessèd they will sleep the whole night through!<br/>
Oh, if these days they keep them free from sin<br/>
Toward Ilion’s conquered shrines and Them within<br/>
Who watch unconquered, maybe not again<br/>
The smiter shall be smit, the taker ta’en.<br/>
May God but grant there fall not on that host<br/>
The greed of gold that maddeneth and the lust<br/>
To spoil inviolate things! But half the race<br/>
Is run which windeth back to home and peace.<br/>
Yea, though of God they pass unchallengèd,<br/>
Methinks the wound of all those desolate dead<br/>
Might waken, groping for its will….<br/>

Which made our Greeks curse God—how should this be?<br/>
Two enemies most ancient, Fire and Sea,<br/>
A sudden friendship swore, and proved their plight<br/>

Towered over us, and winds from Strymon drave<br/>

Of the mad whirlwind gored and overborne,<br/>
One here, one there, ’mid rain and blinding spray,<br/>

And when the blessèd Sun upraised his head,<br/>
We saw the Aegean waste a-foam with dead,<br/>
Dead men, dead ships, and spars disasterful.<br/>

Out of that wrath was stolen or begged free<br/>
By some good spirit—sure no man was he!—<br/>
Who guided clear our helm; and on till now<br/>
Hath Saviour Fortune throned her on the prow.<br/>
No surge to mar our mooring, and no floor<br/>
Of rock to tear us when we made for shore.<br/>
Till, fled from that sea-hell, with the clear sun<br/>
Above us and all trust in fortune gone,<br/>
We drove like sheep about our brain the thoughts<br/>
Of that lost army, broken and scourged with knouts<br/>
Of evil. And, methinks, if there is breath<br/>
In them, they talk of us as gone to death—<br/>
How else?—and so say we of them! For thee,<br/>
Since Menelaüs thy first care must be,<br/>
If by some word of Zeus, who wills not yet<br/>
To leave the old house for ever desolate,<br/>
Some ray of sunlight on a far-off sea<br/>
Lights him, yet green and living … we may see<br/>
His ship some day in the harbour!—’Twas the word<br/>
Of truth ye asked me for, and truth ye have heard!

The point of pleasure, nor stint too soon?<br/>

Ill-helmed and blindly steered was it,<br/>
Pursuing ever, through men that die,<br/>
One wild heart that was fain to fly.<br/>

From the deep of my thought and in love, I say<br/>
“Sweet is a grief well ended;”<br/>

Of them that were left to guard the walls<br/>
Of thine empty Hall unfriended.

To Argos and the gods of Argolis<br/>
All hail, who share with me the glory of this<br/>
Home-coming and the vengeance I did wreak<br/>
On Priam’s City! Yea, though none should speak,<br/>
The great gods heard our cause, and in one mood<br/>
Uprising, in the urn of bitter blood,<br/>
That men should shriek and die and towers should burn,<br/>
Cast their great vote; while over Mercy’s urn<br/>
Hope waved her empty hands and nothing fell.<br/>
Even now in smoke that City tells her tale;<br/>
The wrack-wind liveth, and where Ilion died<br/>
The reek of the old fatness of her pride<br/>
From hot and writhing ashes rolls afar.<br/>
For which let thanks, wide as our glories are,<br/>
Be uplifted; seeing the Beast of Argos hath<br/>
Round Ilion’s towers piled high his fence of wrath<br/>
And, for one woman ravished, wrecked by force<br/>
A City. Lo, the leap of the wild Horse<br/>
in darkness when the Pleiades were dead;<br/>
A mailed multitude, a Lion unfed,<br/>
Which leapt the tower and lapt the blood of Kings!
</p>
<p class="noindent">Lo, to the Gods I make these thanksgivings.<br/>
But for thy words: I marked them, and I mind<br/>
Their meaning, and my voice shall be behind<br/>
Thine. For not many men, the proverb saith,<br/>
Can love a friend whom fortune prospereth<br/>
Unenvying; and about the envious brain<br/>
Cold poison clings, and doubles all the pain<br/>
Life brings him. His own woundings he must nurse,<br/>
And feels another’s gladness like a curse.
</p>
<p class="noindent">Well can I speak. I know the mirrored glass<br/>
Called friendship, and the shadow shapes that pass<br/>
And feign them a King’s friends. I have known but one—<br/>
Odysseus, him we trapped against his own<br/>
Will!—who once harnessed bore his yoke right well …<br/>
Be he alive or dead of whom I tell<br/>
The tale. And for the rest, touching our state<br/>
And gods, we will assemble in debate<br/>
A concourse of all Argos, taking sure<br/>
Counsel, that what is well now may endure<br/>
Well, and if aught needs healing medicine, still<br/>
By cutting and by fire, with all good will,<br/>
I will essay to avert the after-wrack<br/>
Such sickness breeds.
</p>
<p class="noindent">Aye, Heaven hath led me back;<br/>

Ye Elders, Council of the Argive name<br/>
Here present, I will no more hold it shame<br/>
To lay my passion bare before men’s eyes.<br/>
There comes a time to a woman when fear dies<br/>
For ever. None hath taught me. None could tell,<br/>
Save me, the weight of years intolerable<br/>
I lived while this man lay at Ilion.<br/>
That any woman thus should sit alone<br/>
In a half-empty house, with no man near,<br/>
Makes her half-blind with dread! And in her ear<br/>
Alway some voice of wrath; now messengers<br/>
Of evil; now not so; then others worse,<br/>
Crying calamity against mine and me.<br/>
Oh, had he half the wounds that variously<br/>
Came rumoured home, his flesh must be a net,<br/>
All holes from heel to crown! And if he met<br/>
As many deaths as I met tales thereon,<br/>
Is he some monstrous thing, some Gêryon<br/>
Three-souled, that will not die, till o’er his head,<br/>
Three robes of earth be piled, to hold him dead?<br/>
Aye, many a time my heart broke, and the noose<br/>
Of death had got me; but they cut me loose.<br/>
It was those voices alway in mine ear.
</p>
<p class="noindent">For that, too, young Orestes is not here<br/>
Beside me, as were meet, seeing he above<br/>
All else doth hold the surety of our love;<br/>
Let not thy heart be troubled. It fell thus:<br/>
Our loving spear-friend took him, Strophius<br/>
The Phocian, who forewarned me of annoy<br/>
Two-fronted, thine own peril under Troy,<br/>
And ours here, if the rebel multitude<br/>
Should cast the Council down. It is men’s mood<br/>
Alway, to spurn the fallen. So spake he,<br/>
And sure no guile was in him.
</p>
<p class="noindent">But for me,<br/>
The old stormy rivers of my grief are dead<br/>
Now at the spring; not one tear left unshed.<br/>
Mine eyes are sick with vigil, endlessly<br/>
Weeping the beacon-piles that watched for thee<br/>
For ever answerless. And did I dream,<br/>
A gnat’s thin whirr would start me, like a scream<br/>
Of battle, and show me thee by terrors swept,<br/>
Crowding, too many for the time I slept.
</p>
<p class="noindent">From all which stress delivered and free-souled,<br/>
I greet my lord: O watchdog of the fold,<br/>
O forestay sure that fails not in the squall,<br/>
O strong-based pillar of a towering hall;<br/>
O single son to a father age-ridden;<br/>
O land unhoped for seen by shipwrecked men;<br/>
Sunshine more beautiful when storms are fled;<br/>
Spring of quick water in a desert dead ….<br/>
How sweet to be set free from any chain!
</p>
<p class="noindent">These be my words to greet him home again.<br/>
No god shall grudge them. Surely I and thou<br/>
Have suffered in time past enough! And now<br/>
Dismount, O head with love and glory crowned,<br/>
From this high car; yet plant not on bare ground<br/>
Thy foot, great King, the foot that trampled Troy.<br/>
Ho, bondmaids, up! Forget not your employ,<br/>
A floor of crimson broideries to spread<br/>
For the King’s path. Let all the ground be red<br/>
Where those feet pass; and Justice, dark of yore,<br/>
Home light him to the hearth he looks not for!<br/>
What followeth next, our sleepless care shall see<br/>
Ordered as God’s good pleasure may decree.

Music about it, like a choir which sings<br/>
One-voiced, but not well-sounding, for not good<br/>

For ever! Against him no word was cried,<br/>
When, recking not, as ’twere a beast that died,<br/>
With flocks abounding o’er his wide domain,<br/>
He slew his child, my love, my flower of pain, …<br/>
Great God, as magic for the winds of Thrace!<br/>
Why was not he man-hunted from his place,<br/>
To purge the blood that stained him? … When the deed<br/>
Is mine, oh, then thou art a judge indeed!<br/>
But threat thy fill. I am ready, and I stand<br/>
Content; if thy hand beateth down my hand,<br/>
Thou rulest. If aught else be God’s decree,<br/>
Thy lesson shall be learned, though late it be.
</p>
<p class="noindent">CHORUS.<br/>
Thy thought, it is very proud;<br/>
Thy breath is the scorner’s breath;<br/>
Is not the madness loud<br/>
In thy heart, being drunk with death?<br/>
Yea, and above thy brow<br/>
A star of the wet blood burneth!<br/>
Oh, doom shall have yet her day,<br/>
The last friend cast away,<br/>
When lie doth answer lie<br/>
And a stab for a stab returneth!
</p>
<p class="noindent">CLYTEMNESTRA.<br/>
And heark what Oath-gods gather to my side!<br/>
By my dead child’s Revenge, now satisfied,<br/>
By Mortal Blindness, by all Powers of Hell<br/>
Which Hate, to whom in sacrifice he fell,<br/>
My Hope shall walk not in the house of Fear,<br/>
While on my hearth one fire yet burneth clear,<br/>
One lover, one <a href="#fn-50" id="fnref-50" class="pginternal">Aigisthos</a>, as of old!<br/>
What should I fear, when fallen here I hold<br/>
This foe, this scorner of his wife, this toy<br/>
And fool of each Chryseis under Troy;<br/>
And there withal his soothsayer and slave,<br/>
His chanting bed-fellow, his leman brave,<br/>
Who rubbed the galleys’ benches at his side.<br/>
But, oh, they had their guerdon as they died!<br/>
For he lies thus, and she, the wild swan’s way,<br/>
Hath trod her last long weeping roundelay,<br/>
And lies, his lover, ravisht o’er the main<br/>
For his bed’s comfort and my deep disdain.
</p>
<p class="noindent">CHORUS. (<i>Some Elders</i>.)</p>
<p class="noindent">Would God that suddenly<br/>
With no great agony,<br/>
No long sick-watch to keep,<br/>

</p>
<p class="noindent">AIGISTHOS.<br/>
O shining day, O dawn of righteousness<br/>
Fulfilled! Now, now indeed will I confess<br/>
That divine watchers o’er man’s death and birth<br/>
Look down on all the anguish of the earth,<br/>
Now that I see him lying, as I love<br/>
To see him, in this net the Furies wove,<br/>
To atone the old craft of his father’s hand.<br/>
For Atreus, this man’s father, in this land<br/>
Reigning, and by Thyestes in his throne<br/>
Challenged—he was his brother and mine own<br/>
Father From home and city cast him out;<br/>
And he, after long exile, turned about<br/>
And threw him suppliant on the hearth, and won<br/>
Promise of so much mercy, that his own<br/>
Life-blood should reek not in his father’s hall.<br/>
Then did that godless brother, Atreus, call,<br/>
To greet my sire—More eagerness, O God,<br/>
Was there than love!—a feast of brotherhood.<br/>
And, feigning joyous banquet, laid as meat<br/>
Before him his dead children. The white feet<br/>
And finger-fringèd hands apart he set,<br/>
Veiled from all seeing, and made separate<br/>
The tables. And he straightway, knowing naught,<br/>
Took of those bodies, eating that which wrought<br/>
No health for all his race. And when he knew<br/>
The unnatural deed, back from the board he threw,<br/>
Spewing that murderous gorge, and spurning brake<br/>
The table, to make strong the curse he spake:<br/>
“Thus perish all of <a href="#fn-54" id="fnref-54" class="pginternal">Pleisthenês</a> begot!”<br/>
For that lies this man here; and all the plot<br/>
Is mine, most righteously. For me, the third,<br/>
When butchering my two brethren, Atreus spared<br/>
And cast me with my broken sire that day,<br/>
A little thing in swaddling clothes, away<br/>
To exile; where I grew, and at the last<br/>
Justice hath brought me home! Yea though outcast<br/>
In a far land, mine arm hath reached this king;<br/>
My brain, my hate, wrought all the counselling;<br/>
And all is well. I have seen mine enemy<br/>
Dead in the snare, and care not if I die!
</p>
<p class="noindent">LEADER.<br/>
Aigisthos, to insult over the dead<br/>
I like not. All the counsel, thou hast said,<br/>
Was thine alone; and thine the will that spilled<br/>
This piteous blood. As justice is fulfilled,<br/>
Thou shalt not ’scape—so my heart presageth—-The<br/>
day of cursing and the hurlèd death.

I fear me, when Obedience is the word.<br/>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-1"/> <a href="#fnref-1" class="pginternal">[P. 1, l. 1.]</a>—The
Watchman, like most characters in Greek tragedy, comes from the Homeric
tradition, though in Homer (Od. iv. 524) he is merely a servant of Aigisthos.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-2"/> <a href="#fnref-2" class="pginternal">[P. 2, l. 28, Women’s
triumph cry.]</a>—This cry of the women recurs several times in the play:
cf. p. 26, ll. 587 ff., p. 55, l. 1234. It is conventionally represented by
“ololû”; as the cry to Apollo, Paian is “I-ê,” l. 146,
and Cassandra’s sob is “ototoi” or “otototoi,” p.
47.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-3"/> <a href="#fnref-3" class="pginternal">[Pp. 3 f., ll. 40
ff.]</a>—With this silent scene of Clytemnestra’s, compare the long
silence of Cassandra below, and the silence of Prometheus in that play until
his torturers have left him. See the criticism of Aeschylus in Aristophanes,
<i>Frogs</i>, ll. 911-920, pp. 68, 69 in my translation.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-4"/> <a href="#fnref-4" class="pginternal">[P. 5, l. 104, Sign of the
War-Way.]</a>—i.e. an ominous sign seen by the army as it started on its
journey. In Homer, Iliad, ll. 305-329, it is a snake which eats the nine young
of a mother bird and then the mother, and is turned into stone
afterwards.—All through this chorus the language of the prophet Calchas
is intentionally obscure and riddling—the style of prophesy.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-5"/> <a href="#fnref-5" class="pginternal">[P. 7, l. 146, But I-ê,
i-ê.]</a>—(Pronounce <i>Ee-ay</i>.) Calchas, catching sight in his vision
of the further consequences which Artemis will exact if she fulfils the sign,
calls on Apollo Paian, the Healer, to check her.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-6"/> <a href="#fnref-6" class="pginternal">[P. 7, l. 160, Zeus,
whate’er He be.]</a>—This conception of Zeus is expressed also in
Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliant Women</i>, and was probably developed in the
Prometheus Trilogy. See my <i>Rise of the Greek Epic</i>, p. 291 (Ed. 2).<br/>
    It is connected with the common Greek conception of the <i>Tritos
Sôtêr</i>— the Saviour Third. First, He who sins; next, He who avenges;
third, He who saves. In vegetation worship it is the Old Year who has committed
Hubris, the sin of pride, in summer; the Winter who slays him; the New Year
which shall save. In mythology the three successive Rulers of Heaven are given
by Hesiod as Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus (cf. <i>Prometheus</i>, 965 ff.), but we
cannot tell if Aeschylus accepted the Hesiodic story. Cf. note on l. 246, and
Clytemnestra’s blasphemy at l. 1387, p. 63.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-7"/> <a href="#fnref-7" class="pginternal">[P. 9, l. 192, Winds from
Strymon.]</a>—From the great river gorge of Thrace, NNE; cf. below, l.
1418.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-8"/> <a href="#fnref-8" class="pginternal">[P. 9, l. 201,
Artemis.]</a>—Her name was terrible, because of its suggestion. She
demanded the sacrifice of Agamemnon’s daughter, Iphigenîa. (See
Euripides’ two plays, <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> and <i>Iphigenia in
Aulis</i>.) In other poets Agamemnon has generally committed some definite sin
against Artemis, but in Aeschylus the death of Iphigenîa seems to be merely one
of the results of his acceptance of the Sign.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-9"/> <a href="#fnref-9" class="pginternal">[P. 10, l. 215, ’Tis a
Rite of old.]</a>—Literally “it is Themis.” Human sacrifice
had had a place in the primitive religion of Greece; hence Agamemnon could not
reject the demand of the soldiers as an obvious crime. See <i>Rise of Greek
Epic</i>, pp. 150-157.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-10"/> <a href="#fnref-10" class="pginternal">[P. 11, l. 246, The Third
Cup.]</a>—Regularly poured to Zeus Sôtêr, the Saviour, and accompanied by
a paean or cry of joy.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-11"/> <a href="#fnref-11" class="pginternal">[P. 11, l. 256, This Heart
of Argos, this frail Tower:]</a>—i.e. themselves.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-12"/> <a href="#fnref-12" class="pginternal">[P. 11, l. 264,
Glad-voiced.]</a>—Clytemnestra is in extreme suspense, as the return of
Agamemnon will mean either her destruction or her deliverance. At such a moment
there must be no ill-omened word, so she challenges fate.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-13"/> <a href="#fnref-13" class="pginternal">[P. 12, l. 276, A word
within that hovereth without wings.]</a>—i.e. a presentiment. “Winged words”
are words spoken, which fly from speaker to hearer. A ‘wingless’ word is
unspoken. The phrase occurs in Homer.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-14"/> <a href="#fnref-14" class="pginternal">[Pp. 13 ff., ll. 281
ff.]</a>—Beacon Speech. There is no need to inquire curiously into the
practical possibility of this chain of beacons. Greek tragedies do not care to
be exact about this kind of detail. There may well have been a tradition that
Agamemnon, like the Great King of Persia, used a chain of beacons across the
Aegean.—Note how vividly Clytemnestra’s imagination is working in
her excitement. She seems to see before her every leaping light in the chain,
just as in the next speech she imagines the scene in Troy almost with the
intensity of a vision.

clairvoyants. Being consulted, they look into some pool of liquid or the like;
there they see gradually emerging the palace, the injured King, the deserted

full of love for his home and everything he sees. A marked contrast to
Agamemnon, ll. 810 ff. Note that his first speech confirms all the worst fears
suggested by Clytemnestra. Agamemnon has committed all the sins she prayed
against, and more. The terrible lines 527 ff., “Till her Gods’

and a woman. Homer (Od. iii. 309 f.) derives it from a rejoicing by Orestes
over Aigisthos and Clytemnestra; cf. below, ll. 1316 ff., p. 59; Aeschylus here
and Sophocles in the <i>Electra</i>, from a celebration by Clytemnestra of the
deaths of Agamemnon and Cassandra. Probably it was really some ordinary New
Year and Old Year celebration to which the poets give a tragic touch. It seems
to have had a woman’s “Ololugmos” in it, perhaps uttered by
men. See Kaibel’s note, Soph. <i>Electra</i> 277-281.

digressions generally are when they occur in Greek plays, to the poet feeling
bound to follow the tradition. Homer begins his longest account of the slaying
of Agamemnon by asking “Where was Menelaus?” (Od. iii. 249).
Agamemnon could be safely attacked because he was alone. Menelaus was away,
wrecked or wind-bound.

<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-29"/> <a href="#fnref-29" class="pginternal">[P. 29, CHORUS. The name
HELENA.]</a>—There was a controversy in Aeschylus’ day whether
language, including names, was a matter of Convention or of Nature. Was it mere
accident, and could you change the name of anything at will? Or was language a
thing rooted in nature and fixed by God from of old? Aeschylus adopts the
latter view: Why was this being called Helena? If one had understood
God’s purpose one would have seen it was because she really <i>was</i>
“Helenâs”—<i>Ship-destroyer</i>. (The Herald’s story of
the shipwreck has suggested this particular idea.) Similarly, if a hero was
called Aias, and came to great sorrow, one could see that he was so called from
‘Aiai,’ “Alas!”—The antistrophe seems to find a
meaning in the name Paris or Alexandras, where the etymology is not so clear.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-30"/> <a href="#fnref-30" class="pginternal">[Pp. 33
ff.]</a>—Entrance of Agamemnon. The metre of the Chorus indicates
marching; so that apparently the procession takes some time to move across the
orchestra and get into position. Cassandra would be dressed, as a prophetess,
in a robe of white reaching to the feet, covered by an <i>agrênon</i>, or net
of wool with large meshes; she would have a staff and certain fillets or
crowns. The Leader welcomes the King: he explains that, though he was against
the war ten years ago, and has not changed his opinion, he is a faithful
servant of the King … and that not all are equally so. He gave a similar hint
to the Herald above, ll. 546-550, p. 24.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-31"/> <a href="#fnref-31" class="pginternal">[P. 35,
Agamemnon.]</a>—A hard, cold speech, full of pride in the earlier part,
and turning to ominous threats at the end. Those who have dared to be false
shall be broken.—At the end comes a note of fear, like the fear in
Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. He is so full of triumph and success; he
must be very careful not to provoke a fall.—Victory, Nike, was to the
Greeks a very vivid and infectious thing. It clung to you or it deserted you.
And one who was really charged with Victory, like Agamemnon, was very valuable
to his friends and people. Hence they made statues of Victory wingless—so
that she should not fly away. See <i>Four Stages of Greek Religion</i>, p. 138
note.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-32"/> <a href="#fnref-32" class="pginternal">[P. 36,
Clytemnestra.]</a>—A wonderful speech. It seems to me that
Aeschylus’ imagination realized all the confused passions in
Clytemnestra’s mind, but that his art was not yet sufficiently developed
to make them all clear and explicit. She is in suspense; does Agamemnon know
her guilt or not? At least, if she is to die, she wants to say something to
justify or excuse herself in the eyes of the world. A touch of hysteria creeps
in; why could he not have been killed in all these years? Why must he rise,
like some monster from the grave, unkillable? Gradually she recovers her calm,
explains clearly the suspicious point of Orestes’ absence, and heaps up
her words and gestures of welcome to an almost oriental fullness (which
Agamemnon rebukes, ll. 918 ff., p. 39). Again, at the end, when she finds that
for the time she is safe, her real feelings almost break out.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-33"/> <a href="#fnref-33" class="pginternal">[P. 38.]</a>—What is
the motive of the Crimson Tapestries? I think the tangling robe must have been
in the tradition, as the murder in the bath certainly was. One motive, of
course, is obvious: Clytemnestra is tempting Agamemnon to sin or “go too
far.” He tries to resist, but the splendour of an oriental homecoming
seduces him and he yields. But is that enough to account for such a curious
trait in the story, and one so strongly emphasized? We are told afterwards that
Clytemnestra threw over her victim an “endless web,” long and rich
(p. 63), to prevent his seeing or using his arms. And I cannot help suspecting
that this endless web was the same as the crimson pall.<br/>
    If one tries to conjecture the origin of this curious story, it is perhaps
a clue to realize that the word <i>droitê</i> means both a bath and a
sarcophagus, or rather that the thing called droitê, a narrow stone or marble
vessel about seven feet long, was in pre-classical and post-classical times
used as a sarcophagus, but in classical times chiefly or solely as a bath. If
among the prehistoric graves at Mycenae some later peasants discovered a royal
mummy or skeleton in a sarcophagus, wrapped in a robe of royal crimson, and
showing signs of violent death—such as Schliemann believed that he
discovered—would they not say: “We found the body of a King
murdered in a bath, and wrapped round and round in a great robe?”

is drawn to Cassandra. She too is one of Aeschylus’ silent figures. I
imagine her pale, staring in front of her, almost as if in a trance, until
terror seizes her at Clytemnestra’s greeting in l. 1035, p. 45.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-38"/> <a href="#fnref-38" class="pginternal">[P. 41, l. 964, The

inner sanctuary at Delphi and was interpreted by the priests.—The last
two lines of the speech are plain in their meaning but hard to translate.
Literally: “when the full, or fulfilled, man walketh his home,—O
Zeus the Fulfiller, fulfil my prayers.”
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-39"/> <a href="#fnref-39" class="pginternal">[P. 42, l.

boding song: every audience at a Greek tragedy would expect next to hear a
death cry from within, or to see a horrified messenger rush out. Instead of
which the door opens and there is Clytemnestra: what does she want? “Come
thou also!” One victim is not enough.—In the next scene we must
understand the cause of Clytemnestra’s impatience. If she stays too long
outside, some one will warn Agamemnon; if she leaves Cassandra, she with her
second sight will warn the Chorus. If Cassandra could only be got inside all
would be safe!

translated as if it was all addressed to Cassandra: “But if you do not
understand what I say, please indicate the same with your barbarous

probably touches her, and the touch as it were breaks the spell.

direction: she utters a long low sob.—The exclamation which I have
translated “Dreams!” seems to occur when people see ghosts or
visions. <i>Alcestis</i>, 261; <i>Prometheus</i>, 567. Cf. <i>Phoenissae</i>
1296.—“Mine enemy!” The name “Apollon” suggested
“<i>apollyon,”</i> Destroying … the form which is actually used in
the Book of Revelation (Rev. ix. 11).<br/>
    Observe how, during the lyric scene, Cassandra’s vision grows
steadily more definite: First vague horror of the House: then the sobbing of
children, slain long ago: then, a new deed of blood coming; a woman in it: a
wife: then, with a great effort, an attempt to describe the actual slaying in
the bath. Lastly, the sight of herself among the slain. (This last point is
greatly developed by Euripides, <i>Trojan Women</i>, ll. 445 ff., pp. 33
f.).<br/>
    The story of the Children of Thyestes is given below, ll. 1590 ff., p. 73.
Procnê (or Philomêla) was an Attic princess who, in fury against her Thracian
husband, Tereus, killed their child Itys, or Itylus, and was changed into a
nightingale, to weep for him for ever.

<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-45"/> <a href="#fnref-45" class="pginternal">[P. 52, ll. 1178
ff.]</a>—Dialogue. During the lyrics Cassandra has been
“possessed” or “entranced”: the turn to dialogue marks
a conscious attempt to control herself and state plainly her message of
warning. In order to prove her power, she first tells the Elders of deeds done
in the past which are known to them but cannot have been known to her. When
once they are convinced of her true seercraft, she will be able to warn them of
what is coming!—The short ‘stichom[^y]thia’[**TR: This is a y
with a circumflex, not a superscript.] (line for line dialogue), dealing in
awed whispers with things which can hardly be spoken, leaves the story of
Cassandra still a mystery. Then her self-control breaks and the power of the
God sweeps irresistibly upon her; cf. below, ll. 1256 ff.; where it comes at
her like a visible shape of fire, a thing not uncommon with modern
clairvoyants.

condemned or even ridiculed; I think, through misunderstanding. We knew the Old
Men were helpless, like “dreams wandering in the day.” It is
essential to the story that when the crisis comes they shall be found wanting.
But they are neither foolish nor cowardly; each utterance in itself is natural
and characteristic, but counsels are divided. One would like to know whether
Aeschylus made them speak together confusedly, as would certainly be done on
the modern stage, or whether the stately conventions of Greek tragedy preferred
that each speaker should finish his say. In any case, what happens is that
after a moment or two of confused counsel the Elders determine to break into
the Palace, but as they are mounting the steps the great doors are flung open
and Clytemnestra confronts them, standing over the dead bodies of Agamemnon and
Cassandra.<br/>
    The illusion intended is that the Elders have entered the Palace and
discovered Clytemnestra. But, as the mechanical arrangements of the Greek stage
were not equal to this sudden change of scene, and since also it would, even
with perfect machinery, have a tiresome interrupting effect, a slight confusion
or inconsistency is allowed. We are supposed to be inside the house; but as a
matter of fact the supposition is soon forgotten, and the play goes on without
any attention to the particular place of the action. On Clytemnestra’s
speech see Introduction, p. xiii.
