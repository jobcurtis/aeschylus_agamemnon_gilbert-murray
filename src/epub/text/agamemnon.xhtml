					<p>WATCHMAN<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a>.<br/>
					This waste of year-long vigil I have prayed<br/>
					God for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,<br/>
					As sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae’s hall,<br/>
					Till well I know yon midnight festival<br/>
					Of swarming stars, and them that lonely go,<br/>
					Bearers to man of summer and of snow,<br/>
					Great lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.<br/>
					And still I await the sign, the beacon pyre<br/>
					That bears Troy’s capture on a voice of flame<br/>
					Shouting o’erseas. So surely to her aim<br/>
					Cleaveth a woman’s heart, man-passioned!<br/>
					And when I turn me to my bed—my bed<br/>
					Dew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near<br/>
					Cometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear<br/>
					Breathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain<br/>
					To close may close too well to wake again;<br/>
					Think I perchance to sing or troll a tune<br/>
					For medicine against sleep, the music soon<br/>
					Changes to sighing for the tale untold<br/>
					Of this house, not well mastered as of old.<br/>
					Howbeit, may God yet send us rest, and light<br/>
					The flame of good news flashed across the night.</p>
					<p>[<i>He is silent, watching. Suddenly at a distance in the night there is a glimmer of fire, increasing presently to a blaze.</i>]</p>
					<p>Ha!<br/>
					O kindler of the dark, O daylight birth<br/>
					Of dawn and dancing upon Argive earth<br/>
					For this great end! All hail!—What ho, within!<br/>
					What ho! Bear word to Agamemnon’s queen<br/>
					To rise, like dawn, and lift in answer strong<br/>
					To this glad lamp her women’s triumph-song,<br/>
					If verily, verily, Ilion’s citadel<br/>
					Is fallen, as yon beacons flaming tell.<br/>
					And I myself will tread the dance before<br/>
					All others; for my master’s dice I score<br/>
					Good, and mine own to-night three sixes plain.</p>
					<p>[<i>Lights begin to show in the Palace</i>.]</p>
					<p>Oh, good or ill, my hand shall clasp again<br/>
					My dear lord’s hand, returning! Beyond that<br/>
					I speak not. A great ox hath laid his weight<br/>
					Across my tongue. But these stone walls know well,<br/>
					If stones had speech, what tale were theirs to tell.<br/>
					For me, to him that knoweth I can yet<br/>
					Speak; if another questions I forget.</p>
					<p>[<i>Exit into the Palace. The women’s “Ololûgê” or triumph-cry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a>, is heard within and then repeated again and again further off in the City. Handmaids and Attendants come from the Palace, bearing torches, with which they kindle incense on the altars. Among them comes</i> CLYTEMNESTRA<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a>, <i>who throws herself on her knees at the central Altar in an agony of prayer.</i>]</p>
					<p>[<i>Presently from the further side of the open space appear the</i> CHORUS <i>of</i> ELDERS <i>and move gradually into position in front of the Palace. The day begins to dawn.</i>]</p>
					<p>CHORUS.<br/>
					Ten years since Ilion’s righteous foes,<br/>
					The Atreidae strong,<br/>
					Menelaüs and eke Agamemnon arose,<br/>
					Two thrones, two sceptres, yoked of God;<br/>
					And a thousand galleys of Argos trod<br/>
					The seas for the righting of wrong;<br/>
					And wrath of battle about them cried,<br/>
					As vultures cry,<br/>
					Whose nest is plundered, and up they fly<br/>
					In anguish lonely, eddying wide,<br/>
					Great wings like oars in the waste of sky,<br/>
					Their task gone from them, no more to keep<br/>
					Watch o’er the vulture babes asleep.<br/>
					But One there is who heareth on high<br/>
					Some Pan or Zeus, some lost Apollo—<br/>
					That keen bird-throated suffering cry<br/>
					Of the stranger wronged in God’s own sky;<br/>
					And sendeth down, for the law transgressed,<br/>
					The Wrath of the Feet that follow.</p>
					<p>So Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend,<br/>
					Zeus who Prevaileth, in after quest<br/>
					For One Belovèd by Many Men<br/>
					On Paris sent the Atreidae twain;<br/>
					Yea, sent him dances before the end<br/>
					For his bridal cheer,<br/>
					Wrestlings heavy and limbs forespent<br/>
					For Greek and Trojan, the knee earth-bent,<br/>
					The bloody dust and the broken spear.<br/>
					He knoweth, that which is here is here,<br/>
					And that which Shall Be followeth near;<br/>
					He seeketh God with a great desire,<br/>
					He heaps his gifts, he essays his pyre<br/>
					With torch below and with oil above,<br/>
					With tears, but never the wrath shall move<br/>
					Of the Altar cold that rejects his fire.</p>
					<p>We saw the Avengers go that day,<br/>
					And they left us here; for our flesh is old<br/>
					And serveth not; and these staves uphold<br/>
					A strength like the strength of a child at play.<br/>
					For the sap that springs in the young man’s hand<br/>
					And the valour of age, they have left the land.<br/>
					And the passing old, while the dead leaf blows<br/>
					And the old staff gropeth his three-foot way,<br/>
					Weak as a babe and alone he goes,<br/>
					A dream left wandering in the day.</p>
					<p>[<i>Coming near the Central Altar they see</i> CLYTEMNESTRA, <i>who is still rapt in prayer</i>.]</p>
					<p>But thou, O daughter of Tyndareus,<br/>
					Queen Clytemnestra, what need? What news?<br/>
					What tale or tiding hath stirred thy mood<br/>
					To send forth word upon all our ways<br/>
					For incensed worship? Of every god<br/>
					That guards the city, the deep, the high,<br/>
					Gods of the mart, gods of the sky,<br/>
					The altars blaze.<br/>
					One here, one there,<br/>
					To the skyey night the firebrands flare,<br/>
					Drunk with the soft and guileless spell<br/>
					Of balm of kings from the inmost cell.<br/>
					Tell, O Queen, and reject us not,<br/>
					All that can or that may be told,<br/>
					And healer be to this aching thought,<br/>
					Which one time hovereth, evil-cold,<br/>
					And then from the fires thou kindlest<br/>
					Will Hope be kindled, and hungry Care<br/>
					Fall back for a little while, nor tear<br/>
					The heart that beateth below my breast.</p>
					<p>[CLYTEMNESTRA <i>rises silently, as though unconscious of their presence, and goes into the House. The</i> CHORUS <i>take position and begin their first Stasimon, or Standing-song,</i>]</p>
					<p>CHORUS.<br/>
					(<i>The sign seen on the way; Eagles tearing a hare with young</i>.)</p>
					<p>It is ours to tell of the Sign of the War-way<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> given,<br/>
					To men more strong,<br/>
					(For a life that is kin unto ours yet breathes from heaven<br/>
					A spell, a Strength of Song:)<br/>
					How the twin-throned Might of Achaia, one Crown divided<br/>
					Above all Greeks that are,<br/>
					With avenging hand and spear upon Troy was guided<br/>
					By the Bird of War.<br/>
					’Twas a King among birds to each of the Kings of the Sea,<br/>
					One Eagle black, one black but of fire-white tail,<br/>
					By the House, on the Spear-hand, in station that all might see;<br/>
					And they tore a hare, and the life in her womb that grew,<br/>
					Yea, the life unlived and the races unrun they slew.<br/>
					<i>Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail</i>!</p>
					<p>(<i>How Calchas read the sign; his Vision of the Future</i>.)</p>
					<p>And the War-seer wise, as he looked on the Atreid Yoke<br/>
					Twain-tempered, knew<br/>
					Those fierce hare-renders the lords of his host; and spoke,<br/>
					Reading the omen true.<br/>
					“At the last, the last, this Hunt hunteth Ilion down,<br/>
					Yea, and before the wall<br/>
					Violent division the fulness of land and town<br/>
					Shall waste withal;<br/>
					If only God’s eye gloom not against our gates,<br/>
					And the great War-curb of Troy, fore-smitten, fail.<br/>
					For Pity lives, and those wingèd Hounds she hates,<br/>
					Which tore in the Trembler’s body the unborn beast.<br/>
					And Artemis abhorreth the eagles’ feast.”<br/>
					<i>Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail</i>!</p>
					<p>(<i>He prays to Artemis to grant the fulfilment of the Sign, but, as his vision increases, he is afraid and calls on Paian, the Healer, to hold her back</i>.)</p>
					<p>“Thou beautiful One, thou tender lover<br/>
					Of the dewy breath of the Lion’s child;<br/>
					Thou the delight, through den and cover,<br/>
					Of the young life at the breast of the wild,<br/>
					Yet, oh, fulfill, fulfill The sign of the Eagles’ Kill!<br/>
					Be the vision accepted, albeit horrible….<br/>
					But I-ê, I-ê<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a>! Stay her, O Paian, stay!<br/>
					For lo, upon other evil her heart she setteth,<br/>
					Long wastes of wind, held ship and unventured sea,<br/>
					On, on, till another Shedding of Blood be wrought:<br/>
					They kill but feast not; they pray not; the law is broken;<br/>
					Strife in the flesh, and the bride she obeyeth not,<br/>
					And beyond, beyond, there abideth in wrath reawoken—<br/>
					It plotteth, it haunteth the house, yea, it never forgetteth—<br/>
					Wrath for a child to be.”<br/>
					So Calchas, reading the wayside eagles’ sign,<br/>
					Spake to the Kings, blessings and words of bale;<br/>
					And like his song be thine,<br/>
					<i>Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail</i>!</p>
					<p>(<i>Such religion belongs to old and barbarous gods, and brings no peace. I turn to Zeus, who has shown man how to Learn by Suffering</i>.)</p>
					<p>Zeus! Zeus, whate’er He be<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a>,<br/>
					If this name He love to hear<br/>
					This He shall be called of me.<br/>
					Searching earth and sea and air</p>
					<p>Refuge nowhere can I find<br/>
					Save Him only, if my mind<br/>
					Will cast off before it die<br/>
					The burden of this vanity.</p>
					<p>One there was who reigned of old,<br/>
					Big with wrath to brave and blast,<br/>
					Lo, his name is no more told!<br/>
					And who followed met at last<br/>
					His Third-thrower, and is gone.<br/>
					Only they whose hearts have known<br/>
					Zeus, the Conqueror and the Friend,<br/>
					They shall win their vision’s end;</p>
					<p>Zeus the Guide, who made man turn<br/>
					Thought-ward, Zeus, who did ordain<br/>
					Man by Suffering shall Learn.<br/>
					So the heart of him, again<br/>
					Aching with remembered pain,<br/>
					Bleeds and sleepeth not, until<br/>
					Wisdom comes against his will.<br/>
					’Tis the gift of One by strife<br/>
					Lifted to the throne of life.</p>
					<p>(AGAMEMNON <i>accepted the sign. Then came long delay, and storm while the fleet lay at Aulis.</i>)</p>
					<p>So that day the Elder Lord,<br/>
					Marshal of the Achaian ships,<br/>
					Strove not with the prophet’s word,<br/>
					Bowed him to his fate’s eclipse,<br/>
					When with empty jars and lips<br/>
					Parched and seas impassable<br/>
					Fate on that Greek army fell,<br/>
					Fronting Chalcis as it lay,<br/>
					By Aulis in the swirling bay.</p>
					<p>(<i>Till at last Calchas answered that Artemis was wroth and demanded the death of</i> AGAMEMNON’S <i>daughter. The King’s doubt and grief</i>.)</p>
					<p>And winds, winds blew from Strymon River<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a>,<br/>
					Unharboured, starving, winds of waste endeavour,<br/>
					Man-blinding, pitiless to cord and bulwark,<br/>
					And the waste of days was made long, more long,<br/>
					Till the flower of Argos was aghast and withered;<br/>
					Then through the storm rose the War-seer’s song,<br/>
					And told of medicine that should tame the tempest,<br/>
					But bow the Princes to a direr wrong.<br/>
					Then “Artemis”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a> he whispered, he named the name;<br/>
					And the brother Kings they shook in the hearts of them,<br/>
					And smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came.</p>
					<p>But the King, the elder, hath found voice and spoken:<br/>
					“A heavy doom, sure, if God’s will were broken;<br/>
					But to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth,<br/>
					Is that not heavy? That her blood should flow<br/>
					On her father’s hand, hard beside an altar?<br/>
					My path is sorrow wheresoe’er I go.<br/>
					Shall Agamemnon fail his ships and people,<br/>
					And the hosts of Hellas melt as melts the snow?<br/>
					They cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell,<br/>
					For a Virgin’s blood: ’tis a rite of old<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a>, men tell.<br/>
					And they burn with longing.—O God may the end be well!”</p>
					<p>(<i>But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice.</i>)</p>
					<p>To the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly,<br/>
					And a strange wind within his bosom tossed,<br/>
					A wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;<br/>
					And he rose up, daring to the uttermost.<br/>
					For men are boldened by a Blindness, straying<br/>
					Toward base desire, which brings grief hereafter,<br/>
					Yea, and itself is grief;<br/>
					So this man hardened to his own child’s slaying,<br/>
					As help to avenge him for a woman’s laughter<br/>
					And bring his ships relief!</p>
					<p>Her “Father, Father,” her sad cry that lingered,<br/>
					Her virgin heart’s breath they held all as naught,<br/>
					Those bronze-clad witnesses and battle-hungered;<br/>
					And there they prayed, and when the prayer was wrought<br/>
					He charged the young men to uplift and bind her,<br/>
					As ye lift a wild kid, high above the altar,<br/>
					Fierce-huddling forward, fallen, clinging sore<br/>
					To the robe that wrapt her; yea, he bids them hinder<br/>
					The sweet mouth’s utterance, the cries that falter,<br/>
					—His curse for evermore!—</p>
					<p>With violence and a curb’s voiceless wrath.<br/>
					Her stole of saffron then to the ground she threw,<br/>
					And her eye with an arrow of pity found its path<br/>
					To each man’s heart that slew:<br/>
					A face in a picture, striving amazedly;<br/>
					The little maid who danced at her father’s board,<br/>
					The innocent voice man’s love came never nigh,<br/>
					Who joined to his her little paean-cry<br/>
					When the third cup<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> was poured….</p>
					<p>What came thereafter I saw not neither tell.<br/>
					But the craft of Calchas failed not.—’Tis written, He<br/>
					Who Suffereth Shall Learn; the law holdeth well.<br/>
					And that which is to be,<br/>
					Ye will know at last; why weep before the hour?<br/>
					For come it shall, as out of darkness dawn.<br/>
					Only may good from all this evil flower;<br/>
					So prays this Heart of Argos, this frail tower<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a><br/>
					Guarding the land alone.</p>
					<p>[<i>As they cease,</i> CLYTEMNESTRA <i>comes from the Palace with Attendants. She has finished her prayer and sacrifice, and is now wrought up to face the meeting with her husband. The Leader approaches her</i>.]</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Before thy state, O Queen, I bow mine eyes.<br/>
					’Tis written, when the man’s throne empty lies,<br/>
					The woman shall be honoured.—Hast thou heard<br/>
					Some tiding sure? Or is it Hope, hath stirred<br/>
					To fire these altars? Dearly though we seek<br/>
					To learn, ’tis thine to speak or not to speak.</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA.<br/>
					Glad-voiced<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a>, the old saw telleth, comes this morn,<br/>
					The Star-child of a dancing midnight born,<br/>
					And beareth to thine ear a word of joy<br/>
					Beyond all hope: the Greek hath taken Troy.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					How?<br/>
					Thy word flies past me, being incredible.</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA.<br/>
					Ilion is ours. No riddling tale I tell.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Such joy comes knocking at the gate of tears.</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA.<br/>
					Aye, ’tis a faithful heart that eye declares.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					What warrant hast thou? Is there proof of this?</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA.<br/>
					There is; unless a God hath lied there is.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Some dream-shape came to thee in speaking guise?</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA.<br/>
					Who deemeth me a dupe of drowsing eyes?</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Some word within that hovereth without wings?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a></p>

					Am I a child to hearken to such things?</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Troy fallen?—But how long? When fell she, say?</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA.<br/>
					The very night that mothered this new day.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					And who of heralds with such fury came?</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a><br/>
					A Fire-god, from Mount Ida scattering flame.<br/>
					Whence starting, beacon after beacon burst<br/>
					In flaming message hitherward. Ida first<br/>
					Told Hermes’ Lemnian Rock, whose answering sign<br/>
					Was caught by towering Athos, the divine,<br/>
					With pines immense—yea, fishes of the night<br/>
					Swam skyward, drunken with that leaping light,<br/>
					Which swelled like some strange sun, till dim and far<br/>
					Makistos’ watchmen marked a glimmering star;<br/>
					They, nowise loath nor idly slumber-won,<br/>
					Spring up to hurl the fiery message on,<br/>
					And a far light beyond the Eurîpus tells<br/>
					That word hath reached Messapion’s sentinels.<br/>
					They beaconed back, then onward with a high<br/>
					Heap of dead heather flaming to the sky.<br/>
					And onward still, not failing nor aswoon,<br/>
					Across the Asôpus like a beaming moon<br/>
					The great word leapt, and on Kithairon’s height<br/>
					Uproused a new relay of racing light.<br/>
					His watchers knew the wandering flame, nor hid<br/>
					Their welcome, burning higher than was bid.<br/>
					Out over Lake Gorgôpis then it floats,<br/>
					To Aigiplanctos, waking the wild goats,<br/>
					Crying for “Fire, more Fire!” And fire was reared,<br/>
					Stintless and high, a stormy streaming beard,<br/>
					That waved in flame beyond the promontory<br/>
					Rock-ridged, that watches the Saronian sea,<br/>
					Kindling the night: then one short swoop to catch<br/>
					The Spider’s Crag, our city’s tower of watch;<br/>
					Whence hither to the Atreidae’s roof it came,<br/>
					A light true-fathered of Idaean flame.<br/>
					Torch-bearer after torch-bearer, behold<br/>
					The tale thereof in stations manifold,<br/>
					Each one by each made perfect ere it passed,<br/>
					And Victory in the first as in the last.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a><br/>
					These be my proofs and tokens that my lord<br/>
					From Troy hath spoke to me a burning word.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Woman, speak on. Hereafter shall my prayer<br/>
					Be raised to God; now let me only hear,<br/>
					Again and full, the marvel and the joy.</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA.<br/>
					Now, even now, the Achaian holdeth Troy!<br/>
					Methinks there is a crying in her streets<br/>
					That makes no concord. When sweet unguent meets<br/>
					With vinegar in one phial, I warrant none<br/>
					Shall lay those wranglers lovingly at one.<br/>
					So conquerors and conquered shalt thou hear,<br/>
					Two sundered tones, two lives of joy or fear.<br/>
					Here women in the dust about their slain,<br/>
					Husbands or brethren, and by dead old men<br/>
					Pale children who shall never more be free,<br/>
					For all they loved on earth cry desolately.<br/>
					And hard beside them war-stained Greeks, whom stark<br/>
					Battle and then long searching through the dark<br/>
					Hath gathered, ravenous, in the dawn, to feast<br/>
					At last on all the plenty Troy possessed,<br/>
					No portion in that feast nor ordinance,<br/>
					But each man clutching at the prize of chance.<br/>
					Aye, there at last under good roofs they lie<br/>
					Of men spear-quelled, no frosts beneath the sky,<br/>
					No watches more, no bitter moony dew….<br/>
					How blessèd they will sleep the whole night through!<br/>
					Oh, if these days they keep them free from sin<br/>
					Toward Ilion’s conquered shrines and Them within<br/>
					Who watch unconquered, maybe not again<br/>
					The smiter shall be smit, the taker ta’en.<br/>
					May God but grant there fall not on that host<br/>
					The greed of gold that maddeneth and the lust<br/>
					To spoil inviolate things! But half the race<br/>
					Is run which windeth back to home and peace.<br/>
					Yea, though of God they pass unchallengèd,<br/>
					Methinks the wound of all those desolate dead<br/>
					Might waken, groping for its will….<br/>
					Ye hear<br/>
					A woman’s word<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a>, belike a woman’s fear.<br/>
					May good but conquer in the last incline<br/>
					Of the balance! Of all prayers that prayer is mine.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					O Woman, like a man faithful and wise<br/>
					Thou speakest. I accept thy testimonies<br/>
					And turn to God with praising, for a gain<br/>
					Is won this day that pays for all our pain.</p>
					<p>[CLYTEMNESTRA <i>returns to the Palace. The</i> CHORUS <i>take up their position for the Second Stasimon.</i>]</p>
					<p>AN ELDER.<br/>
					O Zeus, All-ruler, and Night the Aid,<br/>
					Gainer of glories, and hast thou thrown<br/>
					Over the towers of Ilion<br/>
					Thy net close-laid,<br/>
					That none so nimble and none so tall<br/>
					Shall escape withal<br/>
					The snare of the slaver that claspeth all?</p>
					<p>ANOTHER.<br/>
					And Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend<br/>
					I also praise, who hath wrought this end.<br/>
					Long since on Paris his shaft he drew,<br/>
					And hath aimèd true,<br/>
					Not too soon falling nor yet too far,<br/>
					The fire of the avenging star.</p>
					<p>CHORUS.<br/>
					(<i>This is God’s judgement upon Troy. May it not be too fierce! Gold cannot save one who spurneth Justice</i>.)</p>
					<p>The stroke of Zeus hath found them! Clear this day<br/>
					The tale, and plain to trace.<br/>
					He judged, and Troy hath fallen.—And have men said<br/>
					That God not deigns to mark man’s hardihead,<br/>
					Trampling to earth the grace<br/>
					Of holy and delicate things?—Sin lies that way.<br/>
					For visibly Pride doth breed its own return<br/>
					On prideful men, who, when their houses swell<br/>
					With happy wealth, breathe ever wrath and blood.<br/>
					Yet not too fierce let the due vengeance burn;<br/>
					Only as deemeth well<br/>
					One wise of mood.</p>
					<p>Never shall state nor gold<br/>
					Shelter his heart from aching<br/>
					Whoso the Altar of Justice old<br/>
					Spurneth to Night unwaking.</p>
					<p>(<i>The Sinner suffers in his longing till at last Temptation overcomes him; as longing for Helen overcame Paris.</i>)</p>
					<p>The tempting of misery forceth him, the dread<br/>
					Child of fore-scheming Woe!<br/>
					And help is vain; the fell desire within<br/>
					Is veilèd not, but shineth bright like Sin:<br/>
					And as false gold will show<br/>
					Black where the touchstone trieth, so doth fade<br/>
					His honour in God’s ordeal. Like a child,<br/>
					Forgetting all, he hath chased his wingèd bird,<br/>
					And planted amid his people a sharp thorn.<br/>
					And no God hears his prayer, or, have they heard,<br/>
					The man so base-beguiled<br/>
					They cast to scorn.</p>
					<p>Paris to Argos came;<br/>
					Love of a woman led him;<br/>
					So God’s altar he brought to shame,<br/>
					Robbing the hand that fed him.</p>
					<p>(<i>Helen’s flight; the visions seen by the King’s seers; the phantom of Helen and the King’s grief.</i>)</p>
					<p>She hath left among her people a noise of shield and sword,<br/>
					A tramp of men armed where the long ships are moored;<br/>
					She hath ta’en in her goings Desolation as a dower;<br/>
					She hath stept, stept quickly, through the great gated Tower,<br/>
					And the thing that could not be, it hath been!<br/>
					And the Seers they saw visions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a>, and they spoke of strange ill:<br/>

					—Nevermore! Nevermore!—from his arms it vanisheth,<br/>
					On wings down the pathways of sleep.</p>
					<p>In the mid castle hall, on the hearthstone of the Kings,<br/>
					These griefs there be, and griefs passing these,<br/>

					<p>And the gold-changer, Ares, who changeth quick for dead,<br/>
					Who poiseth his scale in the striving of the spears,<br/>
					Back from Troy sendeth dust, heavy dust, wet with tears,<br/>
					Sendeth ashes with men’s names in his urns neatly spread.<br/>

					And mockers chid me: “Because beacons show<br/>

					Yet gave I sacrifice; and by my word<br/>
					Through all the city our woman’s cry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a> was heard,<br/>
					Lifted in blessing round the seats of God,<br/>

					Word that the terror of her prayers is come;<br/>
					One wound in her great heart, and many a fate<br/>
					For many a home of men cast out to sate<br/>

					That is Hell’s triumph. But to come as I<br/>
					Am now come, laden with deliverance high,<br/>
					Home to a land of peace and laughing eyes,<br/>
					And mar all with that fury of the skies<br/>
					Which made our Greeks curse God—how should this be?<br/>
					Two enemies most ancient, Fire and Sea,<br/>
					A sudden friendship swore, and proved their plight<br/>
					By war on us poor sailors through that night<br/>
					Of misery, when the horror of the wave<br/>
					Towered over us, and winds from Strymon drave<br/>
					Hull against hull, till good ships, by the horn<br/>
					Of the mad whirlwind gored and overborne,<br/>
					One here, one there, ’mid rain and blinding spray,<br/>
					Like sheep by a devil herded, passed away.<br/>
					And when the blessèd Sun upraised his head,<br/>
					We saw the Aegean waste a-foam with dead,<br/>
					Dead men, dead ships, and spars disasterful.<br/>
					Howbeit for us, our one unwounded hull<br/>
					Out of that wrath was stolen or begged free<br/>
					By some good spirit—sure no man was he!—<br/>
					Who guided clear our helm; and on till now<br/>
					Hath Saviour Fortune throned her on the prow.<br/>
					No surge to mar our mooring, and no floor<br/>
					Of rock to tear us when we made for shore.<br/>
					Till, fled from that sea-hell, with the clear sun<br/>
					Above us and all trust in fortune gone,<br/>
					We drove like sheep about our brain the thoughts<br/>
					Of that lost army, broken and scourged with knouts<br/>
					Of evil. And, methinks, if there is breath<br/>
					In them, they talk of us as gone to death—<br/>
					How else?—and so say we of them! For thee,<br/>
					Since Menelaüs thy first care must be,<br/>
					If by some word of Zeus, who wills not yet<br/>
					To leave the old house for ever desolate,<br/>
					Some ray of sunlight on a far-off sea<br/>
					Lights him, yet green and living … we may see<br/>
					His ship some day in the harbour!—’Twas the word<br/>

					And she changed the bridegroom’s name:<br/>
					Called him Paris Ghastly-wed;<br/>
					For her sons were with the dead,<br/>
					And her life one lamentation,<br/>
					’Mid blood and burning flame.</p>
					<p>(<i>Like a lion’s whelp reared as a pet and turning afterwards to a great beast of prey,</i>)</p>
					<p>Lo, once there was a herdsman reared<br/>
					In his own house, so stories tell,<br/>

					And soft in life’s first opening<br/>

					And old men smiled, and oft, they say,<br/>
					In men’s arms, like a babe, he lay,<br/>
					Bright-eyed, and toward the hand that teased him<br/>
					Eagerly fawning for food or play.</p>
					<p>Then on a day outflashed the sudden<br/>
					Rage of the lion brood of yore;<br/>
					He paid his debt to them that fed<br/>
					With wrack of herds and carnage red,<br/>

					A sight the thralls fled weeping from,<br/>
					A great red slayer, beard a-foam,<br/>
					High-priest of some blood-cursèd altar<br/>
					God had uplifted against that home.</p>
					<p>(<i>So was it with Helen in Troy.</i>)</p>
					<p>And how shall I call the thing that came<br/>
					At the first hour to Ilion city?<br/>
					Call it a dream of peace untold,<br/>
					A secret joy in a mist of gold,<br/>
					A woman’s eye that was soft, like flame,<br/>
					A flower which ate a man’s heart with pity.</p>
					<p>But she swerved aside and wrought to her kiss a bitter ending,<br/>
					And a wrath was on her harbouring, a wrath upon her friending,<br/>
					When to Priam and his sons she fled quickly o’er the deep,<br/>
					With the god to whom she sinned for her watcher on the wind,<br/>
					A death-bride, whom brides long shall weep.</p>
					<p>(<i>Men say that Good Fortune wakes the envy of God; not so; Good Fortune may be innocent, and then there is no vengeance</i>.)</p>

					A tear unstanched and a heart broken.</p>

					Can love a friend whom fortune prospereth<br/>
					Unenvying; and about the envious brain<br/>
					Cold poison clings, and doubles all the pain<br/>
					Life brings him. His own woundings he must nurse,<br/>
					And feels another’s gladness like a curse.</p>
					<p>Well can I speak. I know the mirrored glass<br/>
					Called friendship, and the shadow shapes that pass<br/>
					And feign them a King’s friends. I have known but one—<br/>
					Odysseus, him we trapped against his own<br/>
					Will!—who once harnessed bore his yoke right well …<br/>
					Be he alive or dead of whom I tell<br/>
					The tale. And for the rest, touching our state<br/>
					And gods, we will assemble in debate<br/>
					A concourse of all Argos, taking sure<br/>
					Counsel, that what is well now may endure<br/>
					Well, and if aught needs healing medicine, still<br/>
					By cutting and by fire, with all good will,<br/>
					I will essay to avert the after-wrack<br/>
					Such sickness breeds.</p>
					<p>Aye, Heaven hath led me back;<br/>
					And on this hearth where still my fire doth burn<br/>
					I will go pay to heaven my due return,<br/>

					Ye Elders, Council of the Argive name<br/>
					Here present, I will no more hold it shame<br/>
					To lay my passion bare before men’s eyes.<br/>
					There comes a time to a woman when fear dies<br/>
					For ever. None hath taught me. None could tell,<br/>
					Save me, the weight of years intolerable<br/>
					I lived while this man lay at Ilion.<br/>
					That any woman thus should sit alone<br/>
					In a half-empty house, with no man near,<br/>
					Makes her half-blind with dread! And in her ear<br/>
					Alway some voice of wrath; now messengers<br/>
					Of evil; now not so; then others worse,<br/>
					Crying calamity against mine and me.<br/>
					Oh, had he half the wounds that variously<br/>
					Came rumoured home, his flesh must be a net,<br/>
					All holes from heel to crown! And if he met<br/>
					As many deaths as I met tales thereon,<br/>
					Is he some monstrous thing, some Gêryon<br/>
					Three-souled, that will not die, till o’er his head,<br/>
					Three robes of earth be piled, to hold him dead?<br/>
					Aye, many a time my heart broke, and the noose<br/>
					Of death had got me; but they cut me loose.<br/>
					It was those voices alway in mine ear.</p>
					<p>For that, too, young Orestes is not here<br/>
					Beside me, as were meet, seeing he above<br/>
					All else doth hold the surety of our love;<br/>
					Let not thy heart be troubled. It fell thus:<br/>
					Our loving spear-friend took him, Strophius<br/>
					The Phocian, who forewarned me of annoy<br/>
					Two-fronted, thine own peril under Troy,<br/>
					And ours here, if the rebel multitude<br/>
					Should cast the Council down. It is men’s mood<br/>
					Alway, to spurn the fallen. So spake he,<br/>
					And sure no guile was in him.</p>
					<p>But for me,<br/>
					The old stormy rivers of my grief are dead<br/>
					Now at the spring; not one tear left unshed.<br/>
					Mine eyes are sick with vigil, endlessly<br/>
					Weeping the beacon-piles that watched for thee<br/>
					For ever answerless. And did I dream,<br/>
					A gnat’s thin whirr would start me, like a scream<br/>
					Of battle, and show me thee by terrors swept,<br/>
					Crowding, too many for the time I slept.</p>
					<p>From all which stress delivered and free-souled,<br/>
					I greet my lord: O watchdog of the fold,<br/>
					O forestay sure that fails not in the squall,<br/>
					O strong-based pillar of a towering hall;<br/>
					O single son to a father age-ridden;<br/>
					O land unhoped for seen by shipwrecked men;<br/>
					Sunshine more beautiful when storms are fled;<br/>
					Spring of quick water in a desert dead ….<br/>
					How sweet to be set free from any chain!</p>
					<p>These be my words to greet him home again.<br/>
					No god shall grudge them. Surely I and thou<br/>
					Have suffered in time past enough! And now<br/>
					Dismount, O head with love and glory crowned,<br/>
					From this high car; yet plant not on bare ground<br/>
					Thy foot, great King, the foot that trampled Troy.<br/>
					Ho, bondmaids, up! Forget not your employ,<br/>
					A floor of crimson broideries to spread<br/>
					For the King’s path. Let all the ground be red<br/>
					Where those feet pass; and Justice, dark of yore,<br/>
					Home light him to the hearth he looks not for!<br/>
					What followeth next, our sleepless care shall see<br/>
					Ordered as God’s good pleasure may decree.</p>

					Already I showed my people all their path.</p>

					Oh, oh! Agony, agony!<br/>
					Again the awful pains of prophecy<br/>
					Are on me, maddening as they fall….<br/>
					Ye see them there … beating against the wall?<br/>
					So young … like shapes that gather in a dream …<br/>
					Slain by a hand they loved. Children they seem,<br/>
					Murdered … and in their hands they bear baked meat:<br/>
					I think it is themselves. Yea, flesh; I see it;<br/>
					And inward parts…. Oh, what a horrible load<br/>
					To carry! And their father drank their blood.</p>
					<p>From these, I warn ye, vengeance broodeth still,<br/>
					A lion’s rage, which goes not forth to kill<br/>
					But lurketh in his lair, watching the high<br/>
					Hall of my war-gone master … Master? Aye;<br/>
					Mine, mine! The yoke is nailed about my neck….<br/>
					Oh, lord of ships and trampler on the wreck<br/>
					Of Ilion, knows he not this she-wolf’s tongue,<br/>
					Which licks and fawns, and laughs with ear up-sprung,<br/>
					To bite in the end like secret death?—And can<br/>
					The woman? Slay a strong and armèd man? …<br/>
					What fangèd reptile like to her doth creep?<br/>
					Some serpent amphisbene, some Skylla, deep<br/>
					Housed in the rock, where sailors shriek and die,<br/>
					Mother of Hell blood-raging, which doth cry<br/>
					On her own flesh war, war without alloy …<br/>
					God! And she shouted in his face her joy,<br/>
					Like men in battle when the foe doth break.<br/>
					And feigns thanksgiving for his safety’s sake!<br/>
					What if no man believe me? ’Tis all one.<br/>
					The thing which must be shall be; aye, and soon<br/>
					Thou too shalt sorrow for these things, and here<br/>
					Standing confess me all too true a seer.</p>

					I understood, and tremble. Aye, my brain<br/>
					Reels at these visions, beyond guesswork true.<br/>

					Man, thou shalt look on Agamemnon dead.</p>

					O Wolf Apollo, mercy! O agony! …<br/>
					Why lies she with a wolf, this lioness lone,<br/>
					Two-handed, when the royal lion is gone?<br/>
					God, she will kill me! Like to them that brew<br/>
					Poison, I see her mingle for me too<br/>
					A separate vial in her wrath, and swear,<br/>

					And now the Seer, who called me till my call<br/>
					Was perfect, leads me to this last dismay….<br/>
					’Tis not the altar-stone where men did slay<br/>
					My father; ’tis a block, a block with gore<br/>
					Yet hot, that waits me, of one slain before.<br/>
					Yet not of God unheeded shall we lie.<br/>

					The downfallen; a branch where blossometh<br/>
					A sire’s avenging and a mother’s death.<br/>
					Exiled and wandering, from this land outcast,<br/>

					Crown on these sins that have his house downtrod.<br/>

					Hate on a damnèd hater, feigned a friend;<br/>
					How pile perdition round him, hunter-wise,<br/>

					To me this hour was dreamed of long ago;<br/>
					A thing of ancient hate. ’Twas very slow<br/>
					In coming, but it came. And here I stand<br/>
					Even where I struck, with all the deed I planned<br/>
					Done! ’Twas so wrought—what boots it to deny?—<br/>

					To Zeus of Hell<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-50" id="noteref-50" epub:type="noteref">50</a> who guardeth safe his dead!<br/>

					Father From home and city cast him out;<br/>
					And he, after long exile, turned about<br/>
					And threw him suppliant on the hearth, and won<br/>
					Promise of so much mercy, that his own<br/>
					Life-blood should reek not in his father’s hall.<br/>
					Then did that godless brother, Atreus, call,<br/>
					To greet my sire—More eagerness, O God,<br/>
					Was there than love!—a feast of brotherhood.<br/>
					And, feigning joyous banquet, laid as meat<br/>
					Before him his dead children. The white feet<br/>
					And finger-fringèd hands apart he set,<br/>
					Veiled from all seeing, and made separate<br/>
					The tables. And he straightway, knowing naught,<br/>
					Took of those bodies, eating that which wrought<br/>
					No health for all his race. And when he knew<br/>
					The unnatural deed, back from the board he threw,<br/>
					Spewing that murderous gorge, and spurning brake<br/>
					The table, to make strong the curse he spake:<br/>
					“Thus perish all of Pleisthenês<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-55" id="noteref-55" epub:type="noteref">55</a> begot!”<br/>
					For that lies this man here; and all the plot<br/>
					Is mine, most righteously. For me, the third,<br/>
					When butchering my two brethren, Atreus spared<br/>
					And cast me with my broken sire that day,<br/>
					A little thing in swaddling clothes, away<br/>
					To exile; where I grew, and at the last<br/>
					Justice hath brought me home! Yea though outcast<br/>
					In a far land, mine arm hath reached this king;<br/>
					My brain, my hate, wrought all the counselling;<br/>
					And all is well. I have seen mine enemy<br/>
					Dead in the snare, and care not if I die!</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Aigisthos, to insult over the dead<br/>
					I like not. All the counsel, thou hast said,<br/>
					Was thine alone; and thine the will that spilled<br/>
					This piteous blood. As justice is fulfilled,<br/>
					Thou shalt not ’scape—so my heart presageth—-The<br/>
					day of cursing and the hurlèd death.</p>
					<p>AIGISTHOS.<br/>
					How, thou poor oarsman of the nether row<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-56" id="noteref-56" epub:type="noteref">56</a>,<br/>
					When the main deck is master? Sayst thou so?…<br/>
					To such old heads the lesson may prove hard,<br/>
					I fear me, when Obedience is the word.<br/>
					But hunger, and bonds, and cold, help men to find<br/>
					Their wits.—They are wondrous healers of the mind!<br/>
					Hast eyes and seest not this?—Against a spike<br/>
					Kick not, for fear it pain thee if thou strike.</p>
					<p>LEADER (<i>turning from him to</i> CLYTEMNESTRA).</p>
					<p>Woman! A soldier fresh from war! To keep<br/>
					Watch o’er his house and shame him in his sleep…<br/>
					To plot this craft against a lord of spears…</p>
					<p>[CLYTEMNESTRA, <i>as though in a dream, pays no heed.</i> AIGISTHOS <i>interupts.</i>]</p>
					<p>AIGISTHOS.<br/>
					These be the words, old man, that lead to tears!<br/>
					Thou hast an opposite to Orpheus’ tongue,<br/>
					Who chained all things with his enchanting song,<br/>
					For thy mad noise will put the chains on thee.<br/>
					Enough! Once mastered thou shalt tamer be.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Thou master? Is old Argos so accurst?<br/>
					Thou plotter afar off, who never durst<br/>
					Raise thine own hand to affront and strike him down…</p>
					<p>AIGISTHOS.<br/>
					To entice him was the wife’s work. I was known<br/>
					By all men here, his old confessed blood-foe.<br/>
					Howbeit, with his possessions I will know<br/>
					How to be King. And who obeys not me<br/>
					Shall be yoked hard, no easy trace-horse he,<br/>
					Corn-flushed. Hunger, and hunger’s prison mate,<br/>
					The clammy murk, shall see his rage abate.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Thou craven soul! Why not in open strife<br/>
					Slay him? Why lay the blood-sin on his wife,<br/>
					Staining the Gods of Argos, making ill<br/>
					The soil thereof?…But young Orestes still<br/>
					Liveth. Oh, Fate will guide him home again,<br/>
					Avenging, conquering, home to kill these twain!</p>
					<p>AIGISTHOS.<br/>
					’Fore God, if ’tis your pleasure thus to speak and do, ye soon shall hear!<br/>
					Ho there, my trusty pikes, advance! There cometh business for the spear.</p>
					<p>[<i>A body of Spearmen, from concealment outside, rush in and dominate the stage.</i>]</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Ho there, ye Men of Argos! Up! Stand and be ready, sword from sheath!</p>
					<p>AIGISTHOS.<br/>
					By Heaven, I also, sword in hand, am ready, and refuse not death!</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Come, find it! We accept thy word. Thou offerest what we hunger for.</p>
					<p>[<i>Some of the Elders draw swords with the Leader; others have collapsed with weakness. Men from</i> AGAMEMNON’S <i>retinue have gathered and prepare for battle, when, before they can come to blows,</i> CLYTEMNESTRA <i>breaks from her exhausted silence.</i>]</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-57" id="noteref-57" epub:type="noteref">57</a>.<br/>
					Nay, peace, O best-belovèd! Peace! And let us work no evil more.<br/>
					Surely the reaping of the past is a full harvest, and not good,<br/>
					And wounds enough are everywhere.—Let us not stain ourselves with blood.<br/>
					Ye reverend Elders, go your ways, to his own dwelling every one,<br/>
					Ere things be wrought for which men suffer.—What we did must needs be done.<br/>
					And if of all these strifes we now may have no more, oh, I will kneel<br/>
					And praise God, bruisèd though we be beneath the Daemon’s heavy heel.<br/>
					This is the word a woman speaks, to hear if any man will deign.</p>
					<p>AIGISTHOS.<br/>
					And who are these to burst in flower of folly thus of tongue and brain,<br/>
					And utter words of empty sound and perilous, tempting Fortune’s frown,<br/>
					And leave wise counsel all forgot, and gird at him who wears the crown?</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					To cringe before a caitiff’s crown, it squareth not with Argive ways.</p>
					<p>AIGISTHOS. (<i>sheathing his sword and turning from them</i>).</p>
					<p>Bah, I will be a hand of wrath to fall on thee in after days.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Not so, if God in after days shall guide Orestes home again!</p>
					<p>AIGISTHOS.<br/>
					I know how men in exile feed on dreams…and know such food is vain.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Go forward and wax fat! Defile the right for this thy little hour!</p>
					<p>AIGISTHOS.<br/>
					I spare thee now. Know well for all this folly thou shalt feel my power.</p>
					<p>LEADER.<br/>
					Aye, vaunt thy greatness, as a bird beside his mate doth vaunt and swell.</p>
					<p>CLYTEMNESTRA.<br/>
					Vain hounds are baying round thee; oh, forget them! Thou and I shall dwell<br/>
					As Kings in this great House. We two at last will order all things well.</p>
					<p>[<i>The Elders and the remains of</i> AGAMEMNON’S <i>retinue retire sullenly, leaving the Spearmen in possession.</i> CLYTEMNESTRA <i>and</i> AIGISTHOS <i>turn and enter the Palace.</i>]</p>
