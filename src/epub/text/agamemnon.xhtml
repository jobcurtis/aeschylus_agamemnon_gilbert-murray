								<span>This waste of year-long vigil I have prayed</span>

								<span>As vultures cry,</span>

								<span>Whose nest is plundered, and up they fly</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In anguish lonely, eddying wide,</span>

							<p>(<i>The sign seen on the way; Eagles tearing a hare with young</i>.)</p>
							<p>It is ours to tell of the Sign of the War-way<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> given,<br/>
							To men more strong,<br/>
							(For a life that is kin unto ours yet breathes from heaven<br/>
							A spell, a Strength of Song:)<br/>
							How the twin-throned Might of Achaia, one Crown divided<br/>
							Above all Greeks that are,<br/>
							With avenging hand and spear upon Troy was guided<br/>
							By the Bird of War.<br/>
							’Twas a King among birds to each of the Kings of the Sea,<br/>
							One Eagle black, one black but of fire-white tail,<br/>
							By the House, on the Spear-hand, in station that all might see;<br/>
							And they tore a hare, and the life in her womb that grew,<br/>
							Yea, the life unlived and the races unrun they slew.<br/>
							<i>Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail</i>!</p>
							<p>(<i>How Calchas read the sign; his Vision of the Future</i>.)</p>
							<p>And the War-seer wise, as he looked on the Atreid Yoke<br/>
							Twain-tempered, knew<br/>
							Those fierce hare-renders the lords of his host; and spoke,<br/>
							Reading the omen true.<br/>
							“At the last, the last, this Hunt hunteth Ilion down,<br/>
							Yea, and before the wall<br/>
							Violent division the fulness of land and town<br/>
							Shall waste withal;<br/>
							If only God’s eye gloom not against our gates,<br/>
							And the great War-curb of Troy, fore-smitten, fail.<br/>
							For Pity lives, and those wingèd Hounds she hates,<br/>
							Which tore in the Trembler’s body the unborn beast.<br/>
							And Artemis abhorreth the eagles’ feast.”<br/>
							<i>Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail</i>!</p>
							<p>(<i>He prays to Artemis to grant the fulfilment of the Sign, but, as his vision increases, he is afraid and calls on Paian, the Healer, to hold her back</i>.)</p>
							<p>“Thou beautiful One, thou tender lover<br/>
							Of the dewy breath of the Lion’s child;<br/>
							Thou the delight, through den and cover,<br/>
							Of the young life at the breast of the wild,<br/>
							Yet, oh, fulfill, fulfill The sign of the Eagles’ Kill!<br/>
							Be the vision accepted, albeit horrible….<br/>
							But I-ê, I-ê<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a>! Stay her, O Paian, stay!<br/>
							For lo, upon other evil her heart she setteth,<br/>
							Long wastes of wind, held ship and unventured sea,<br/>
							On, on, till another Shedding of Blood be wrought:<br/>
							They kill but feast not; they pray not; the law is broken;<br/>
							Strife in the flesh, and the bride she obeyeth not,<br/>
							And beyond, beyond, there abideth in wrath reawoken—<br/>
							It plotteth, it haunteth the house, yea, it never forgetteth—<br/>
							Wrath for a child to be.”<br/>
							So Calchas, reading the wayside eagles’ sign,<br/>
							Spake to the Kings, blessings and words of bale;<br/>
							And like his song be thine,<br/>
							<i>Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail</i>!</p>
							<p>(<i>Such religion belongs to old and barbarous gods, and brings no peace. I turn to Zeus, who has shown man how to Learn by Suffering</i>.)</p>
							<p>Zeus! Zeus, whate’er He be<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a>,<br/>
							If this name He love to hear<br/>
							This He shall be called of me.<br/>
							Searching earth and sea and air</p>
							<p>Refuge nowhere can I find<br/>
							Save Him only, if my mind<br/>
							Will cast off before it die<br/>
							The burden of this vanity.</p>
							<p>One there was who reigned of old,<br/>
							Big with wrath to brave and blast,<br/>
							Lo, his name is no more told!<br/>
							And who followed met at last<br/>
							His Third-thrower, and is gone.<br/>
							Only they whose hearts have known<br/>
							Zeus, the Conqueror and the Friend,<br/>
							They shall win their vision’s end;</p>
							<p>Zeus the Guide, who made man turn<br/>
							Thought-ward, Zeus, who did ordain<br/>
							Man by Suffering shall Learn.<br/>
							So the heart of him, again<br/>
							Aching with remembered pain,<br/>
							Bleeds and sleepeth not, until<br/>
							Wisdom comes against his will.<br/>
							’Tis the gift of One by strife<br/>
							Lifted to the throne of life.</p>
							<p>(<i><b epub:type="z3998:persona">Agamemnon</b> accepted the sign. Then came long delay, and storm while the fleet lay at Aulis.</i>)</p>
							<p>So that day the Elder Lord,<br/>
							Marshal of the Achaian ships,<br/>
							Strove not with the prophet’s word,<br/>
							Bowed him to his fate’s eclipse,<br/>
							When with empty jars and lips<br/>
							Parched and seas impassable<br/>
							Fate on that Greek army fell,<br/>
							Fronting Chalcis as it lay,<br/>
							By Aulis in the swirling bay.</p>
							<p>(<i>Till at last Calchas answered that Artemis was wroth and demanded the death of <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Agamemnon’s</b> daughter. The King’s doubt and grief</i>.)</p>
							<p>And winds, winds blew from Strymon River<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a>,<br/>
							Unharboured, starving, winds of waste endeavour,<br/>
							Man-blinding, pitiless to cord and bulwark,<br/>
							And the waste of days was made long, more long,<br/>
							Till the flower of Argos was aghast and withered;<br/>
							Then through the storm rose the War-seer’s song,<br/>
							And told of medicine that should tame the tempest,<br/>
							But bow the Princes to a direr wrong.<br/>
							Then “Artemis”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a> he whispered, he named the name;<br/>
							And the brother Kings they shook in the hearts of them,<br/>
							And smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came.</p>
							<p>But the King, the elder, hath found voice and spoken:<br/>
							“A heavy doom, sure, if God’s will were broken;<br/>
							But to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth,<br/>
							Is that not heavy? That her blood should flow<br/>
							On her father’s hand, hard beside an altar?<br/>
							My path is sorrow wheresoe’er I go.<br/>
							Shall Agamemnon fail his ships and people,<br/>
							And the hosts of Hellas melt as melts the snow?<br/>
							They cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell,<br/>
							For a Virgin’s blood: ’tis a rite of old<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a>, men tell.<br/>
							And they burn with longing.—O God may the end be well!”</p>
							<p>(<i>But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice.</i>)</p>
							<p>To the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly,<br/>
							And a strange wind within his bosom tossed,<br/>
							A wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;<br/>
							And he rose up, daring to the uttermost.<br/>
							For men are boldened by a Blindness, straying<br/>
							Toward base desire, which brings grief hereafter,<br/>
							Yea, and itself is grief;<br/>
							So this man hardened to his own child’s slaying,<br/>
							As help to avenge him for a woman’s laughter<br/>
							And bring his ships relief!</p>
							<p>Her “Father, Father,” her sad cry that lingered,<br/>
							Her virgin heart’s breath they held all as naught,<br/>
							Those bronze-clad witnesses and battle-hungered;<br/>
							And there they prayed, and when the prayer was wrought<br/>
							He charged the young men to uplift and bind her,<br/>
							As ye lift a wild kid, high above the altar,<br/>
							Fierce-huddling forward, fallen, clinging sore<br/>
							To the robe that wrapt her; yea, he bids them hinder<br/>
							The sweet mouth’s utterance, the cries that falter,<br/>
							—His curse for evermore!—</p>
							<p>With violence and a curb’s voiceless wrath.<br/>
							Her stole of saffron then to the ground she threw,<br/>
							And her eye with an arrow of pity found its path<br/>
							To each man’s heart that slew:<br/>
							A face in a picture, striving amazedly;<br/>
							The little maid who danced at her father’s board,<br/>
							The innocent voice man’s love came never nigh,<br/>
							Who joined to his her little paean-cry<br/>
							When the third cup<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> was poured….</p>
							<p>What came thereafter I saw not neither tell.<br/>
							But the craft of Calchas failed not.—’Tis written, He<br/>
							Who Suffereth Shall Learn; the law holdeth well.<br/>
							And that which is to be,<br/>
							Ye will know at last; why weep before the hour?<br/>
							For come it shall, as out of darkness dawn.<br/>
							Only may good from all this evil flower;<br/>
							So prays this Heart of Argos, this frail tower<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a><br/>
							Guarding the land alone.</p>

								<br/>
								<span>With pines immense—yea, fishes of the night</span>

								<span>Uproused a new relay of racing light.</span>

								<span>Out over Lake Gorgôpis then it floats,</span>

								<span>Stintless and high, a stormy streaming beard,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That waved in flame beyond the promontory</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rock-ridged, that watches the Saronian sea,</span>

								<span>Kindling the night: then one short swoop to catch</span>

							<p>The stroke of Zeus hath found them! Clear this day<br/>
							The tale, and plain to trace.<br/>
							He judged, and Troy hath fallen.—And have men said<br/>
							That God not deigns to mark man’s hardihead,<br/>
							Trampling to earth the grace<br/>
							Of holy and delicate things?—Sin lies that way.<br/>
							For visibly Pride doth breed its own return<br/>
							On prideful men, who, when their houses swell<br/>
							With happy wealth, breathe ever wrath and blood.<br/>
							Yet not too fierce let the due vengeance burn;<br/>
							Only as deemeth well<br/>
							One wise of mood.</p>
							<p>Never shall state nor gold<br/>
							Shelter his heart from aching<br/>
							Whoso the Altar of Justice old<br/>
							Spurneth to Night unwaking.</p>
							<p>(<i>The Sinner suffers in his longing till at last Temptation overcomes him; as longing for Helen overcame Paris.</i>)</p>

							And help is vain; the fell desire within<br/>
							Is veilèd not, but shineth bright like Sin:<br/>
							And as false gold will show<br/>
							Black where the touchstone trieth, so doth fade<br/>
							His honour in God’s ordeal. Like a child,<br/>
							Forgetting all, he hath chased his wingèd bird,<br/>
							And planted amid his people a sharp thorn.<br/>
							And no God hears his prayer, or, have they heard,<br/>
							The man so base-beguiled<br/>
							They cast to scorn.</p>
							<p>Paris to Argos came;<br/>
							Love of a woman led him;<br/>
							So God’s altar he brought to shame,<br/>
							Robbing the hand that fed him.</p>
							<p>(<i>Helen’s flight; the visions seen by the King’s seers; the phantom of Helen and the King’s grief.</i>)</p>
							<p>She hath left among her people a noise of shield and sword,<br/>
							A tramp of men armed where the long ships are moored;<br/>
							She hath ta’en in her goings Desolation as a dower;<br/>
							She hath stept, stept quickly, through the great gated Tower,<br/>
							And the thing that could not be, it hath been!<br/>
							And the Seers they saw visions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a>, and they spoke of strange ill:<br/>
							“A Palace, a Palace; and a great King thereof:<br/>
							A bed, a bed empty, that was once pressed in love:<br/>
							And thou, thou, what art thou? Let us be, thou so still,<br/>
							Beyond wrath, beyond beseeching, to the lips reft of thee!”<br/>
							For she whom he desireth is beyond the deep sea,<br/>
							And a ghost in his castle shall be queen.</p>
							<p>Images in sweet guise<br/>
							Carven shall move him never,<br/>
							Where is Love amid empty eyes?<br/>
							Gone, gone for ever!</p>
							<p>(<i>His dreams and his suffering; but the War that he made caused greater and wider suffering.</i>)</p>
							<p>But a shape that is a dream, ’mid the phantoms of the night,<br/>
							Cometh near, full of tears, bringing vain vain delight:<br/>
							For in vain when, desiring, he can feel the joy’s breath<br/>
							—Nevermore! Nevermore!—from his arms it vanisheth,<br/>
							On wings down the pathways of sleep.</p>
							<p>In the mid castle hall, on the hearthstone of the Kings,<br/>
							These griefs there be, and griefs passing these,<br/>
							But in each man’s dwelling of the host that sailed the seas,<br/>
							A sad woman waits; she has thoughts of many things,<br/>
							And patience in her heart lieth deep.</p>
							<p>Knoweth she them she sent,<br/>
							Knoweth she? Lo, returning,<br/>
							Comes in stead of the man that went<br/>
							Armour and dust of burning.</p>
							<p>(<i>The return of the funeral urns; the murmurs of the People.</i>)</p>
							<p>And the gold-changer, Ares, who changeth quick for dead,<br/>
							Who poiseth his scale in the striving of the spears,<br/>
							Back from Troy sendeth dust, heavy dust, wet with tears,<br/>
							Sendeth ashes with men’s names in his urns neatly spread.<br/>
							And they weep over the men, and they praise them one by one,<br/>
							How this was a wise fighter, and this nobly-slain—<br/>
							“Fighting to win back another’s wife!”<br/>
							Till a murmur is begun,<br/>
							And there steals an angry pain<br/>
							Against Kings too forward in the strife.</p>
							<p>There by Ilion’s gate<br/>
							Many a soldier sleepeth,<br/>
							Young men beautiful; fast in hate<br/>
							Troy her conqueror keepeth.</p>
							<p>(<i>For the Shedder of Blood is in great peril, and not unmarked by God. May I never be a Sacker of Cities!</i>)</p>
							<p>But the rumour of the People, it is heavy, it is chill;<br/>
							And tho’ no curse be spoken, like a curse doth it brood;<br/>
							And my heart waits some tiding which the dark holdeth still,<br/>
							For of God not unmarked is the shedder of much blood.<br/>
							And who conquers beyond right … Lo, the life of man decays;<br/>
							There be Watchers dim his light in the wasting of the years;<br/>
							He falls, he is forgotten, and hope dies.<br/>
							There is peril in the praise<br/>
							Over-praised that he hears;<br/>
							For the thunder it is hurled from God’s eyes.</p>

							Of her curtains backward rolled,<br/>
							And to sea, to sea, she threw her<br/>
							In the West Wind’s giant hold;<br/>
							And with spear and sword behind her<br/>
							Came the hunters in a flood,<br/>
							Down the oarblade’s viewless trail<br/>
							Tracking, till in Simoïs’ vale<br/>
							Through the leaves they crept to find her,<br/>
							A Wrath, a seed of blood.</p>
							<p>(<i>The Trojans welcomed her with triumph and praised Alexander till at last their song changed and they saw another meaning in Alexander’s name also.</i>)</p>
							<p>So the Name to Ilion came<br/>
							On God’s thought-fulfilling flame,<br/>
							She a vengeance and a token<br/>
							Of the unfaith to bread broken,<br/>
							Of the hearth of God betrayed,<br/>
							Against them whose voices swelled<br/>
							Glorying in the prize they held<br/>
							And the Spoiler’s vaunt outspoken<br/>
							And the song his brethren made<br/>
							’Mid the bridal torches burning;<br/>
							Till, behold, the ancient City<br/>
							Of King Priam turned, and turning<br/>
							Took a new song for her learning,<br/>
							A song changed and full of pity,<br/>
							With the cry of a lost nation;<br/>
							And she changed the bridegroom’s name:<br/>
							Called him Paris Ghastly-wed;<br/>
							For her sons were with the dead,<br/>
							And her life one lamentation,<br/>
							’Mid blood and burning flame.</p>
							<p>(<i>Like a lion’s whelp reared as a pet and turning afterwards to a great beast of prey,</i>)</p>
							<p>Lo, once there was a herdsman reared<br/>
							In his own house, so stories tell,<br/>
							A lion’s whelp, a milk-fed thing<br/>
							And soft in life’s first opening<br/>
							Among the sucklings of the herd;<br/>
							The happy children loved him well,<br/>
							And old men smiled, and oft, they say,<br/>
							In men’s arms, like a babe, he lay,<br/>
							Bright-eyed, and toward the hand that teased him<br/>
							Eagerly fawning for food or play.</p>
							<p>Then on a day outflashed the sudden<br/>
							Rage of the lion brood of yore;<br/>
							He paid his debt to them that fed<br/>
							With wrack of herds and carnage red,<br/>
							Yea, wrought him a great feast unbidden,<br/>
							Till all the house-ways ran with gore;<br/>
							A sight the thralls fled weeping from,<br/>
							A great red slayer, beard a-foam,<br/>
							High-priest of some blood-cursèd altar<br/>
							God had uplifted against that home.</p>
							<p>(<i>So was it with Helen in Troy.</i>)</p>
							<p>And how shall I call the thing that came<br/>
							At the first hour to Ilion city?<br/>
							Call it a dream of peace untold,<br/>
							A secret joy in a mist of gold,<br/>
							A woman’s eye that was soft, like flame,<br/>
							A flower which ate a man’s heart with pity.</p>
							<p>But she swerved aside and wrought to her kiss a bitter ending,<br/>
							And a wrath was on her harbouring, a wrath upon her friending,<br/>
							When to Priam and his sons she fled quickly o’er the deep,<br/>
							With the god to whom she sinned for her watcher on the wind,<br/>
							A death-bride, whom brides long shall weep.</p>
							<p>(<i>Men say that Good Fortune wakes the envy of God; not so; Good Fortune may be innocent, and then there is no vengeance</i>.)</p>
							<p>A grey word liveth, from the morn<br/>
							Of old time among mortals spoken,<br/>
							That man’s Wealth waxen full shall fall<br/>
							Not childless, but get sons withal;<br/>
							And ever of great bliss is born<br/>
							A tear unstanched and a heart broken.</p>
							<p>But I hold my thought alone and by others unbeguiled;<br/>
							’Tis the deed that is unholy shall have issue, child on child,<br/>
							Sin on sin, like his begetters; and they shall be as they were.</p>
							<p>But the man who walketh straight, and the house thereof, tho’ Fate<br/>
							Exalt him, the children shall be fair.</p>
							<p>
								<i>(It is Sin, it is Pride and Ruthlessness, that beget children like themselves till Justice is fulfilled upon them.)</i>
							</p>
							<p>But Old Sin loves, when comes the hour again,<br/>
							To bring forth New,<br/>
							Which laugheth lusty amid the tears of men;<br/>
							Yea, and Unruth, his comrade, wherewith none<br/>
							May plead nor strive, which dareth on and on,<br/>
							Knowing not fear nor any holy thing;<br/>
							Two fires of darkness in a house, born true,<br/>
							Like to their ancient spring.</p>
							<p>But Justice shineth in a house low-wrought<br/>
							With smoke-stained wall,<br/>
							And honoureth him who filleth his own lot;<br/>
							But the unclean hand upon the golden stair<br/>
							With eyes averse she flieth, seeking where<br/>
							Things innocent are; and, recking not the power<br/>
							Of wealth by man misgloried, guideth all<br/>
							To her own destined hour.</p>

								<span>Ye Elders, Council of the Argive name</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Here present, I will no more hold it shame</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To lay my passion bare before men’s eyes.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There comes a time to a woman when fear dies</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For ever. None hath taught me. None could tell,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Save me, the weight of years intolerable</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I lived while this man lay at Ilion.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That any woman thus should sit alone</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In a half-empty house, with no man near,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Makes her half-blind with dread! And in her ear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Alway some voice of wrath; now messengers</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of evil; now not so; then others worse,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Crying calamity against mine and me.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh, had he half the wounds that variously</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Came rumoured home, his flesh must be a net,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All holes from heel to crown! And if he met</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As many deaths as I met tales thereon,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is he some monstrous thing, some Gêryon</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Three-souled, that will not die, till o’er his head,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Three robes of earth be piled, to hold him dead?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Aye, many a time my heart broke, and the noose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of death had got me; but they cut me loose.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It was those voices alway in mine ear.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>For that, too, young Orestes is not here</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beside me, as were meet, seeing he above</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All else doth hold the surety of our love;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let not thy heart be troubled. It fell thus:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our loving spear-friend took him, Strophius</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The Phocian, who forewarned me of annoy</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Two-fronted, thine own peril under Troy,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And ours here, if the rebel multitude</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Should cast the Council down. It is men’s mood</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Alway, to spurn the fallen. So spake he,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And sure no guile was in him.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>But for me,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The old stormy rivers of my grief are dead</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now at the spring; not one tear left unshed.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mine eyes are sick with vigil, endlessly</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Weeping the beacon-piles that watched for thee</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For ever answerless. And did I dream,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A gnat’s thin whirr would start me, like a scream</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of battle, and show me thee by terrors swept,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Crowding, too many for the time I slept.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>From all which stress delivered and free-souled,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I greet my lord: O watchdog of the fold,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O forestay sure that fails not in the squall,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O strong-based pillar of a towering hall;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O single son to a father age-ridden;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O land unhoped for seen by shipwrecked men;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sunshine more beautiful when storms are fled;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Spring of quick water in a desert dead ….</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How sweet to be set free from any chain!</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>These be my words to greet him home again.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No god shall grudge them. Surely I and thou</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have suffered in time past enough! And now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dismount, O head with love and glory crowned,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From this high car; yet plant not on bare ground</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy foot, great King, the foot that trampled Troy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ho, bondmaids, up! Forget not your employ,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A floor of crimson broideries to spread</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the King’s path. Let all the ground be red</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where those feet pass; and Justice, dark of yore,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Home light him to the hearth he looks not for!</span>
								<br/>

								<br/>
